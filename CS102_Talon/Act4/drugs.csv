"1","Characterisation of Anti-Arrhythmic Drug Effects on Cardiac Electrophysiology using Physics-Informed Neural Networks","Ching-En Chiu, Arieh Levy Pinto, Rasheda A Chowdhury, Kim Christensen, Marta Varela","Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)","The ability to accurately infer cardiac electrophysiological (EP) properties is key to improving arrhythmia diagnosis and treatment. In this work, we developed a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) framework to predict how different myocardial EP parameters are modulated by anti-arrhythmic drugs. Using $\textit{in vitro}$ optical mapping images and the 3-channel Fenton-Karma model, we estimated the changes in ionic channel conductance caused by these drugs. Our framework successfully characterised the action of drugs HMR1556, nifedipine and lidocaine - respectively, blockade of $I_{K}$, $I_{Ca}$, and $I_{Na}$ currents - by estimating that they decreased the respective channel conductance by $31.8\pm2.7\%$ $(p=8.2 \times 10^{-5})$, $80.9\pm21.6\%$ $(p=0.02)$, and $8.6\pm0.5\%$ $ (p=0.03)$, leaving the conductance of other channels unchanged. For carbenoxolone, whose main action is the blockade of intercellular gap junctions, PINNs also successfully predicted no significant changes $(p>0.09)$ in all ionic conductances. Our results are an important step towards the deployment of PINNs for model parameter estimation from experimental data, bringing this framework closer to clinical or laboratory images analysis and for the personalisation of mathematical models.","Wed, 13 Mar 2024 11:46:38 UTC (1,035 KB)"
"2","Learning to Describe for Predicting Zero-shot Drug-Drug Interactions","Fangqi Zhu, Yongqi Zhang, Lei Chen, Bing Qin, Ruifeng Xu","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","Adverse drug-drug interactions~(DDIs) can compromise the effectiveness of concurrent drug administration, posing a significant challenge in healthcare. As the development of new drugs continues, the potential for unknown adverse effects resulting from DDIs becomes a growing concern. Traditional computational methods for DDI prediction may fail to capture interactions for new drugs due to the lack of knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a new problem setup as zero-shot DDI prediction that deals with the case of new drugs. Leveraging textual information from online databases like DrugBank and PubChem, we propose an innovative approach TextDDI with a language model-based DDI predictor and a reinforcement learning~(RL)-based information selector, enabling the selection of concise and pertinent text for accurate DDI prediction on new drugs. Empirical results show the benefits of the proposed approach on several settings including zero-shot and few-shot DDI prediction, and the selected texts are semantically relevant.

Honavar","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Recent advancements in biology and chemistry have leveraged multi-modal learning, integrating molecules and their natural language descriptions to enhance drug discovery. However, current pre-training frameworks are limited to two modalities, and designing a unified network to process different modalities (e.g., natural language, 2D molecular graphs, 3D molecular conformations, and 3D proteins) remains challenging due to inherent gaps among them. In this work, we propose MolBind, a framework that trains encoders for multiple modalities through contrastive learning, mapping all modalities to a shared feature space for multi-modal semantic alignment. To facilitate effective pre-training of MolBind on multiple modalities, we also build and collect a high-quality dataset with four modalities, MolBind-M4, including graph-language, conformation-language, graph-conformation, and conformation-protein paired data. MolBind shows superior zero-shot learning performance across a wide range of tasks, demonstrating its strong capability of capturing the underlying semantics of multiple modalities.","Wed, 13 Mar 2024 01:38:42 UTC (2,595 KB)"

We present a novel representation in the form of random walks over the design space, which facilitates both molecule generation and property prediction.

Techniques in deep learning are used to infer atom typing and geometric parameters from a training set. Conformer sampling is achieved by taking advantage of recent advancements in diffusion-based generation. By training on large, synthetic data sets of diverse, drug-like molecules optimized with the semiempirical GFN2-xTB method, high accuracy is achieved for bonded parameters, exceeding that of conventional, knowledge-based methods.

Existing structured-based drug design methods treat all ligand atoms equally, which ignores different roles of atoms in the ligand for drug design and can be less efficient for exploring the large drug-like molecule space. In this paper, inspired by the convention in pharmaceutical practice, we decompose the ligand molecule into two parts, namely arms and scaffold, and propose a new diffusion model, DecompDiff, with decomposed priors over arms and scaffold. In order to facilitate the decomposed generation and improve the properties of the generated molecules, we incorporate both bond diffusion in the model and additional validity guidance in the sampling phase.

Bagnaninchi, Xavier Casadevall i Solvas, Yunjie Yang","Optics (physics.optics)","Advancements in high-throughput biomedical applications necessitate real-time, large field-of-view (FOV) imaging capabilities. Conventional lens-free imaging (LFI) systems, while addressing the limitations of physical lenses, have been constrained by dynamic, hard-to-model optical fields, resulting in a limited one-shot FOV of approximately 20 $mm^2$. This restriction has been a major bottleneck in applications like live-cell imaging and automation of microfluidic systems for biomedical research. Here, we present a deep-learning(DL)-based imaging framework -- GenLFI -- leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) for holographic image reconstruction. We demonstrate that GenLFI can achieve a real-time FOV over 550 $mm^2$, surpassing the current LFI system by more than 20-fold, and even larger than the world's largest confocal microscope by 1.76 times. The resolution is at the sub-pixel level of 5.52 $\mu m$, without the need for a shifting light source. The unsupervised learning-based reconstruction does not require optical field modeling, making imaging dynamic 3D samples (e.g., droplet-based microfluidics and 3D cell models) in complex optical fields possible. This GenLFI framework unlocks the potential of LFI systems, offering a robust tool to tackle new frontiers in high-throughput biomedical applications such as drug discovery.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 16:20:27 UTC (33,800 KB)"
"8","CardioGenAI: A Machine Learning-Based Framework for Re-Engineering Drugs for Reduced hERG Liability","Gregory W. Kyro, Matthew T. Martin, Eric D. Watt, Victor S. Batista","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Drug-induced cardiotoxicity is a major health concern which can lead to serious adverse effects including life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias via the blockade of the voltage-gated hERG potassium ion channel. It is therefore of tremendous interest to develop advanced methods to identify hERG-active compounds in early stages of drug development, as well as to optimize commercially available drugs for reduced hERG activity. In this work, we present CardioGenAI, a machine learning-based framework for re-engineering both developmental and marketed drugs for reduced hERG activity while preserving their pharmacological activity. The framework incorporates novel state-of-the-art discriminative models for predicting hERG channel activity, as well as activity against the voltage-gated NaV1.5 and CaV1.2 channels due to their potential implications in modulating the arrhythmogenic potential induced by hERG channel blockade. These models can also serve independently as effective components of a virtual screening pipeline. We applied the complete framework to pimozide, an FDA-approved antipsychotic agent that demonstrates high affinity to the hERG channel, and generated 100 refined candidates. Remarkably, among the candidates is fluspirilene, a compound which is of the same class of drugs (diphenylmethanes) as pimozide and therefore has similar pharmacological activity, yet exhibits over 700-fold weaker binding to hERG. We have made all of our software open-source to facilitate integration of the CardioGenAI framework for molecular hypothesis generation into drug discovery workflows.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 13:12:24 UTC (2,194 KB)"
"9","An Improved Strategy for Blood Glucose Control Using Multi-Step Deep Reinforcement Learning","Weiwei Gu, Senquan Wang","Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)","Blood Glucose (BG) control involves keeping an individual's BG within a healthy range through extracorporeal insulin injections is an important task for people with type 1 diabetes. However,traditional patient self-management is cumbersome and risky. Recent research has been devoted to exploring individualized and automated BG control approaches, among which Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) shows potential as an emerging approach. In this paper, we use an exponential decay model of drug concentration to convert the formalization of the BG control problem, which takes into account the delay and prolongedness of drug effects, from a PAE-POMDP (Prolonged Action Effect-Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) to a MDP, and we propose a novel multi-step DRL-based algorithm to solve the problem. The Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) sampling method is also used in it. Compared to single-step bootstrapped updates, multi-step learning is more efficient and reduces the influence from biasing targets. Our proposed method converges faster and achieves higher cumulative rewards compared to the benchmark in the same training environment, and improves the time-in-range (TIR), the percentage of time the patient's BG is within the target range, in the evaluation phase. Our work validates the effectiveness of multi-step reinforcement learning in BG control, which may help to explore the optimal glycemic control measure and improve the survival of diabetic patients.","Tue, 12 Mar 2024 11:53:00 UTC (298 KB)"

The model uses a multilayer network to identify the mechanism of drug action and disease comorbidity propagation pathways. The model is tested on the Electronic Health Record (EHR) data of 7859 AF patients from 43 hospitals in Hong Kong. The model outperforms all baselines across all metrics and provides valuable molecular-level insights for clinical use.

"11","3M-Diffusion: Latent Multi-Modal Diffusion for Text-Guided Generation of Molecular Graphs","Huaisheng Zhu, Teng Xiao, Vasant G Honavar","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Generating molecules with desired properties is a critical task with broad applications in drug discovery and materials design. Inspired by recent advances in large language models, there is a growing interest in using natural language descriptions of molecules to generate molecules with the desired properties. Most existing methods focus on generating molecules that precisely match the text description. However, practical applications call for methods that generate diverse, and ideally novel, molecules with the desired properties. We propose 3M-Diffusion, a novel multi-modal molecular graph generation method, to address this challenge. 3M-Diffusion first encodes molecular graphs into a graph latent space aligned with text descriptions. It then reconstructs the molecular structure and atomic attributes based on the given text descriptions using the molecule decoder. It then learns a probabilistic mapping from the text space to the latent molecular graph space using a diffusion model. The results of our extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that 3M-Diffusion can generate high-quality, novel and diverse molecular graphs that semantically match the textual description provided.","Mon, 11 Mar 2024 21:44:54 UTC (985 KB)"

"13","PROTEST: Nonparametric Testing of Hypotheses Enhanced by Experts' Utility Judgements","Rodrigo F. L. Lassance, Rafael Izbicki, Rafael B. Stern","Methodology (stat.ME)","Instead of testing solely a precise hypothesis, it is often useful to enlarge it with alternatives that are deemed to differ from it negligibly. For instance, in a bioequivalence study one might consider the hypothesis that the concentration of an ingredient is exactly the same in two drugs. In such a context, it might be more relevant to test the enlarged hypothesis that the difference in concentration between the drugs is of no practical significance. While this concept is not alien to Bayesian statistics, applications remain confined to parametric settings and strategies on how to effectively harness experts' intuitions are often scarce or nonexistent. To resolve both issues, we introduce PROTEST, an accessible nonparametric testing framework that seamlessly integrates with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We develop expanded versions of the model adherence, goodness-of-fit, quantile and two-sample tests. To demonstrate how PROTEST operates, we make use of examples, simulated studies - such as testing link functions in a binary regression setting, as well as a comparison between the performance of PROTEST and the PTtest (Holmes et al., 2015) - and an application with data on neuron spikes. Furthermore, we address the crucial issue of selecting the threshold - which controls how much a hypothesis is to be expanded - even when intuitions are limited or challenging to quantify.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 20:09:33 UTC (2,329 KB)"

However, the drug sensitivity data in single-cell level is still scarce to date, pressing an urgent and highly challenging task for computational prediction of the drug sensitivity to individual cells. This paper proposed scAdaDrug, a multi-source adaptive weighting model to predict single-cell drug sensitivity. We used an autoencoder to extract domain-invariant features related to drug sensitivity from multiple source domains by exploiting adversarial domain adaptation. Especially, we introduced an adaptive weight generator to produce importance-aware and mutual independent weights, which could adaptively modulate the embedding of each sample in dimension-level for both source and target domains.

Motter","Molecular Networks (q-bio.MN)","Recent developments in synthetic biology, next-generation sequencing, and machine learning provide an unprecedented opportunity to rationally design new disease treatments based on measured responses to gene perturbations and drugs to reprogram cells. The main challenges to seizing this opportunity are the incomplete knowledge of the cellular network and the combinatorial explosion of possible interventions, both of which are insurmountable by experiments. To address these challenges, we develop a transfer learning approach to control cell behavior that is pre-trained on transcriptomic data associated with human cell fates, thereby generating a model of the network dynamics that can be transferred to specific reprogramming goals. The approach combines transcriptional responses to gene perturbations to minimize the difference between a given pair of initial and target transcriptional states. We demonstrate our approach's versatility by applying it to a microarray dataset comprising >9,000 microarrays across 54 cell types and 227 unique perturbations, and an RNASeq dataset consisting of >10,000 sequencing runs across 36 cell types and 138 perturbations. Our approach reproduces known reprogramming protocols with an AUROC of 0.91 while innovating over existing methods by pre-training an adaptable model that can be tailored to specific reprogramming transitions. We show that the number of gene perturbations required to steer from one fate to another increases with decreasing developmental relatedness and that fewer genes are needed to progress along developmental paths than to regress. These findings establish a proof-of-concept for our approach to computationally design control strategies and provide insights into how gene regulatory networks govern phenotype.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 19:00:02 UTC (9,998 KB)"

The expressivity of GNNs with respect to their ability to discriminate non-isomorphic graphs critically depends on the functions employed for message aggregation and graph-level readout. By applying signal propagation theory, we propose a variance-preserving aggregation function (VPA) that maintains expressivity, but yields improved forward and backward dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that VPA leads to increased predictive performance for popular GNN architectures as well as improved learning dynamics. Our results could pave the way towards normalizer-free or self-normalizing GNNs.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 18:52:27 UTC (182 KB)"

Nevertheless, when applying policy gradients to SDEs, since the policy gradient is estimated on a finite set of trajectories, it can be ill-defined, and the policy behavior in data-scarce regions may be uncontrolled. This challenge compromises the stability of policy gradients and negatively impacts sample complexity. To address these issues, we propose constraining the SDE to be consistent with its associated perturbation process. Since the perturbation process covers the entire space and is easy to sample, we can mitigate the aforementioned problems. Our framework offers a general approach allowing for a versatile selection of policy gradient methods to effectively and efficiently train SDEs.

Additionally, these systems often have spatial variation in the diffusion coefficient which must be determined, such as for injectable drug-eluting implants into heterogeneous tissues. Unfortunately, obtaining the diffusion coefficient from images in such cases is an inverse problem with only discrete data points. The development of a robust method that can work with such noisy and ill-posed datasets to accurately determine spatially-varying diffusion coefficients is of great value across a large range of disciplines. Here, we developed an inverse solver that uses physics informed neural networks (PINNs) to calculate spatially-varying diffusion coefficients from numerical and experimental image data in varying biological and engineering applications. The residual of the transient diffusion equation for a concentration field is minimized to find the diffusion coefficient. The robustness of the method as an inverse solver was tested using both numerical and experimental datasets. The predictions show good agreement with both the numerical and experimental benchmarks; an error of less than 6.31% was obtained against all numerical benchmarks, while the diffusion coefficient calculated in experimental datasets matches the appropriate ranges of other reported literature values. Our work demonstrates the potential of using PINNs to resolve spatially-varying diffusion coefficients, which may aid a wide-range of applications, such as enabling better-designed drug-eluting implants for regenerative medicine or oncology fields.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 18:15:47 UTC (1,494 KB)"

In such cases, marginally valid prediction intervals for these focal units can be misleading due to selection bias. This paper presents a general framework for constructing a prediction set with finite-sample exact coverage conditional on the unit being selected. Its general form works for arbitrary selection rules, and generalizes Mondrian Conformal Prediction to multiple test units and non-equivariant classifiers. We then work out computationally efficient implementation of our framework for a number of realistic selection rules, including top-K selection, optimization-based selection, selection based on conformal p-values, and selection based on properties of preliminary conformal prediction sets.

Specifically, achieving a practical molecular design necessitates not only meeting the diversity requirements but also addressing structural and textural constraints with various symmetries outlined by domain experts. In this article, we present an innovative approach to tackle this inverse design problem by formulating it as a multi-modality guidance generation/optimization task. Our proposed solution involves a textural-structure alignment symmetric diffusion framework for the implementation of molecular generation/optimization tasks, namely 3DToMolo. 3DToMolo aims to harmonize diverse modalities, aligning them seamlessly to produce molecular structures adhere to specified symmetric structural and textural constraints by experts in the field.

Although methods have been proposed to generate virtual patient populations using mechanistic models, there are limited number of applications in immuno-oncology research. Furthermore, due to the stricter requirements of digital twins, they are often generated in a study-specific manner with models customized to particular clinical settings (e.g., treatment, cancer, and data types). Here, we discuss the challenges for virtual patient generation in immuno-oncology with our most recent experiences, initiatives to develop digital twins, and how research on these two concepts can inform each other.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 21:38:05 UTC (548 KB)"

As the drug is released at the time when required, its efficacy is boosted and the side effects are minimized. However, so far, drug delivery devices often rely on the passive diffusion process for a sustained release, which is slow and uncontrollable. Here, we present a miniaturized microfluidic device for wirelessly controlled ultrafast active drug delivery, driven by an oscillating solid-liquid interface. The oscillation generates acoustic streaming in the drug reservoir, which opens an elastic valve to deliver the drug. High-speed microscopy reveals the fast response of the valve on the order of 1 ms, which is more than three orders of magnitude faster than the start-of-the-art. The amount of the released drug exhibits a linear relationship with the working time and the electric power applied to the ultrasonic resonator. The trigger of the release is wirelessly controlled via a magnetic field, and the system shows stable output in a continuous experiment for two weeks. The integrated system shows great promise as a long-term controlled drug delivery implant for chronic diseases.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 12:34:36 UTC (7,878 KB)"

Sensing pH at a high spatial and temporal resolution might provide crucial information in understanding the role of pH and its fluctuations in a wide range of physio-pathological cellular processes, including cancer. Here, a method to embed silica-based fluorescent pH sensors into alginate-based three-dimensional (3D) microgels tumour models, coupled with a computational method for fine data analysis, is presented. By means of confocal laser scanning microscopy, live-cell time-lapse imaging of 3D alginate microgels was performed and the extracellular pH metabolic variations were monitored in both in vitro 3D mono- and 3D co-cultures of tumour and stromal pancreatic cells. The results show that the extracellular pH is cell line-specific and time-dependent. Moreover, differences in pH were also detected between 3D monocultures versus 3D co-cultures, thus suggesting the existence of a metabolic crosstalk between tumour and stromal cells. In conclusion, the system has the potential to image multiple live cells types in a 3D environment and to decipher in real-time their pH metabolic interplay under controlled experimental conditions, thus being also a suitable platform for drug screening and personalized medicine.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 10:20:32 UTC (1,735 KB)"

For a fine-tuning of molecular properties without losing bio-activity validated in advance, the concept of bioisosterism has emerged. Many in silico methods have been proposed for discovering bioisosteres, but they require expert knowledge for their applications or are restricted to known databases. Here, we introduce DeepBioisostere, a deep generative model to design suitable bioisosteric replacements. Our model allows an end-to-end chemical replacement by intelligently selecting fragments for removal and insertion along with their attachment orientation. Through various scenarios of multiple property control, we showcase the model's capability to modulate specific properties, addressing the challenge in molecular optimization. Our model's innovation lies in its capacity to design a bioisosteric replacement reflecting the compatibility with the surroundings of the modification site, facilitating the control of sophisticated properties like drug-likeness. DeepBioisostere can also provide previously unseen bioisosteric replacements, highlighting its capability for exploring diverse chemical modifications rather than just mining them from known databases.

There is limited research comparing the renal safety of entecavir and tenofovir when used with pegylated interferon. This study will compare changes in renal function in chronic hepatitis B patients treated with pegylated interferon and either entecavir or tenofovir. The study included a cohort of 836 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) who received treatment with pegylated interferon (IFN) either alone or in combination with entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir (TDF) between the years 2018 and 2021. Of these patients, 713 were included in a matched analysis comparing outcomes between those who were cured and those who were uncured, while 123 patients received IFN alone as a control group for comparison with the ETV and TDF treatment groups. The primary outcome measured was the change in renal function, specifically estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), cystatin C (CysC), and inorganic phosphorus (IPHOS). Patients were categorized into stage 1 or stage 2 based on a baseline eGFR of less than 90 ml/min/m^2 Results: 125 CHB patients were matched 1:1 in both the combined treatment and cured groups. Baseline eGFR, CysC, and IPHOS levels were similar between the groups.

Traditional approaches to dose-finding in Phase I trials, such as the '3+3' method and the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM), provide a principled approach for escalating across dose levels. However, these methods lack the ability to incorporate uncertainty regarding the dose-toxicity ordering as found in combination drug trials. Under this setting, dose-levels vary across multiple drugs simultaneously, leading to multiple possible dose-toxicity orderings. The Partial Ordering CRM (POCRM) extends to these settings by allowing for multiple dose-toxicity orderings. In this work, it is shown that the POCRM is vulnerable to 'estimation incoherency' whereby toxicity estimates shift in an illogical way, threatening patient safety and undermining clinician trust in dose-finding models. To this end, the Bayesian model averaged POCRM (BMA-POCRM) is proposed. BMA-POCRM uses Bayesian model averaging to take into account all possible orderings simultaneously, reducing the frequency of estimation incoherencies. The effectiveness of BMA-POCRM in drug combination settings is demonstrated through a specific instance of estimate incoherency of POCRM and simulation studies. The results highlight the improved safety, accuracy and reduced occurrence of estimate incoherency in trials applying the BMA-POCRM relative to the POCRM model.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 17:38:09 UTC (381 KB)"

The such analysis, the 3D structure of molecules is a fundamental consideration, involving the manipulation of molecular representations based on their degrees of freedom, including rigid roto-translation and fragment rotations along rotatable bonds, to determine the preferred spatial arrangement when molecules bind to each other. In this paper, quantum annealing based solution to solve Molecular unfolding (MU) problem, a specific phase within molecular docking, is explored and compared with a state-of-the-art classical algorithm named ""GeoDock"". Molecular unfolding focuses on expanding a molecule to an unfolded state to simplify manipulation within the target cavity and optimize its configuration, typically by maximizing molecular area or internal atom distances. Molecular unfolding problem aims to find the torsional configuration that increases the inter-atomic distance within a molecule, which also increases the molecular area. Quantum annealing approach first encodes the problem into a Higher-order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) equation which is pruned to an arbitrary percentage to improve the time efficiency and to be able to solve the equation using any quantum annealer.

As the acoustic shock distance decreases with the increase of incident frequency, the nonlinear propagation effect will play a role in acoustic streaming, e.g., Eckart (bulk) streaming at a few gigahertz (GHz). However, the theory of source terms of bulk streaming is still missing at this stage when high-order acoustic harmonics play a role. In this paper, we derive the source term including the contribution of higher-order harmonics. The streaming-induced hydrodynamic flow is assumed to be incompressible and no shock wave occurs during the nonlinear acoustic propagation as restricted by the traditional Goldberg number \Gamma < 1 or \Gamma \approx 1 which indicates the importance of nonlinearity relative to dissipation. The derived force terms allow evaluating bulk streaming with high-order harmonics at GHz and provide an exact expression compared to the existing empirical formulas. Numerical results show that the contribution of higher-order harmonics increases the streaming flow velocity by more than 20%. We show that the expression introduced by Nyborg should be avoided in numerical computations as it includes part of the acoustic radiation force that does not lead to acoustic streaming.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 08:25:18 UTC (624 KB)"

Interpretability of a single feature in a prediction may be handled in multiple ways; however, in a multi-objective prediction, it is difficult to obtain interpretability of a combination of feature values. To address this issue, we propose an objective specific feature interaction design using multi-labels to find the optimal combination of features in agricultural settings. One of the novel aspects of this design is the identification of a method that integrates feature explanations with global sensitivity analysis in order to ensure combinatorial optimization in multi-objective settings. We have demonstrated in our preliminary experiments that an approximate combination of feature values can be found to achieve the desired outcome using two agricultural datasets: one with pre-harvest poultry farm practices for multi-drug resistance presence, and one with post-harvest poultry farm practices for food-borne pathogens. In our combinatorial optimization approach, all three pathogens are taken into consideration simultaneously to account for the interaction between conditions that favor different types of pathogen growth.

In constant environments, increasing cell cycle noise induces a phase transition from complete to fractional killing, while increasing death noise can induce the reverse transition. In periodic drug environments, we discover survival resonance phenomena that give rise to peaks in the survival probabilities at division or death times that are multiples of the environment duration not seen in unstructured populations.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 11:19:12 UTC (850 KB)"

These systems are envisioned to operate on nanoscale and in biological environments, such as the human body, and catalyze the emergence of revolutionary applications in the context of early disease monitoring and drug targeting. However, while a plethora of theoretical (and more recently also more and more practical) MC system designs have been proposed over the past years, some fundamental questions remain open, hindering the breakthrough of MC in real-world applications. One of these questions is: What is a useful measure of information in the context of MC-based applications? While most existing works in MC build upon the concept of syntactic information as introduced by Shannon, in this paper, we explore the framework of semantic information as introduced by Kolchinsky and Wolpert for the information theoretical analysis of a natural MC system, namely bacterial chemotaxis. Exploiting the computational modeling tool of agent-based modeling (ABM), we are able to demonstrate that the semantic information framework can provide a useful information theoretical framework for quantifying the information exchange of chemotactic bacteria with their environment. In particular, we show that the measured semantic information provides a useful measure of the ability of the bacteria to adapt to and survive in a changing environment. Encouraged by our results, we envision that the semantic information framework can open new avenues for developing theoretical and practical MC system designs and in this way help to unleash the full potential of MC for complex adaptive systems-based nanoscale applications.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 16:41:52 UTC (587 KB)"

To address this issue, this paper introduces a hierarchical multi-relational graph representation learning (HMGRL) approach. Within the framework of HMGRL, we leverage a wealth of drug-related heterogeneous data sources to construct heterogeneous graphs, where nodes represent drugs and edges denote clear and various associations. The relational graph convolutional network (RGCN) is employed to capture diverse explicit relationships between drugs from these heterogeneous graphs. Additionally, a multi-view differentiable spectral clustering (MVDSC) module is developed to capture multiple valuable implicit correlations between DPs. Within the MVDSC, we utilize multiple DP features to construct graphs, where nodes represent DPs and edges denote different implicit correlations. Subsequently, multiple DP representations are generated through graph cutting, each emphasizing distinct implicit correlations. The graph-cutting strategy enables our HMGRL to identify strongly connected communities of graphs, thereby reducing the fusion of irrelevant features. By combining every representation view of a DP, we create high-level DP representations for predicting DDIs. Two genuine datasets spanning three distinct tasks are adopted to gauge the efficacy of our HMGRL. Experimental outcomes unequivocally indicate that HMGRL surpasses several leading-edge methods in performance.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 07:36:16 UTC (12,960 KB)"

Alamin Talukder, AKM Azad, Sunil Aryal, Bikash Kumar Paul, Wahia Tasnim, Muhammad Ali Abdulllah Almoyad, Mohammad Ali Moni","Genomics (q-bio.GN)","With the advent of Information technology, the Bioinformatics research field is becoming increasingly attractive to researchers and academicians. The recent development of various Bioinformatics toolkits has facilitated the rapid processing and analysis of vast quantities of biological data for human perception. Most studies focus on locating two connected diseases and making some observations to construct diverse gene regulatory interaction networks, a forerunner to general drug design for curing illness. For instance, Hypopharyngeal cancer is a disease that is associated with EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma. In this study, we select EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma and Hypopharyngeal cancer by finding the Lung metastases in hypopharyngeal cancer. To conduct this study, we collect Mircorarray datasets from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus), an online database controlled by NCBI. Differentially expressed genes, common genes, and hub genes between the selected two diseases are detected for the succeeding move. Our research findings have suggested common therapeutic molecules for the selected diseases based on 10 hub genes with the highest interactions according to the degree topology method and the maximum clique centrality (MCC). Our suggested therapeutic molecules will be fruitful for patients with those two diseases simultaneously.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 11:29:36 UTC (42,535 KB)"
"50","A Scalable Multi-Layered Blockchain Architecture for Enhanced EHR Sharing and Drug Supply Chain Management","Reza Javan, Mehrzad Mohammadi, Mohammad Beheshti-Atashgah, Mohammad Reza Aref","Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)","In recent years, the healthcare sector's shift to online platforms has spotlighted challenges concerning data security, privacy, and scalability. Blockchain technology, known for its decentralized, secure, and immutable nature, emerges as a viable solution for these pressing issues. This article presents an innovative Electronic Health Records (EHR) sharing and drug supply chain management framework tailored to address scalability, security, data integrity, traceability, and secure data sharing. The framework introduces five layers and transactions, prioritizing patient-centric healthcare by granting patients comprehensive access control over their health information. This access facilitates smoother processes, such as insurance claims, while maintaining robust security measures. Notably, our implementation of parallelism significantly bolsters scalability and transaction throughput while minimizing network traffic. Performance evaluations conducted through the Caliper benchmark indicate a slight increase in processor consumption during specific transactions, mitigated effectively by parallelization. RAM requirements remain largely stable. Additionally, our approach notably reduces network traffic while tripling transaction throughput. The framework ensures patient privacy, data integrity, access control, and interoperability, aligning with traditional healthcare systems. Moreover, it provides transparency and real-time drug supply monitoring, empowering decision-makers with actionable insights. As healthcare evolves, our framework sets a crucial precedent for innovative, scalable, and secure systems. Future enhancements could focus on scalability, real-world deployment, standardized data formats, reinforced security protocols, privacy preservation, and IoT integration to comply with regulations and meet evolving industry needs.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 09:20:16 UTC (1,110 KB)"

To complete the screening process, it is essential to have an efficient process for analyzing cell images. This paper presents a new method for efficiently tracking cells and quantitatively detecting the signal ratio between cytoplasm and nuclei. Existing methods include those that use image processing techniques and those that utilize artificial intelligence (AI). However, these methods do not consider the correspondence of cells between images, or require a significant amount of new learning data to train AI. Therefore, our method uses automatic thresholding and labeling algorithms to compare the position of each cell between images, and continuously measure and analyze the signal ratio of cells. This paper describes the algorithm of our method. Using the method, we experimented to investigate the effect of the number of opening and closing operations during the binarization process on the tracking of the cells. Through the experiment, we determined the appropriate number of opening and closing processes.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 08:33:03 UTC (220 KB)"

Parikh (UC Davis), Niki Baccile (LCMCP-SMiLES)","Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)","Myelin figures (MFs) -- cylindrical lyotropic liquid crystalline structures consisting of concentric arrays of bilayers and aqueous media -- arise from the hydration of the bulk lamellar phase of many common amphiphiles. Prior efforts have concentrated on the formation, structure, and dynamics of myelin produced by phosphatidylcholine (PC)-based amphiphiles. Here, we study the myelinization of glycolipid microbial amphiphiles, commonly addressed as biosurfactants, produced through the process of fermentation. The hydration characteristics (and phase diagrams) of these biological amphiphiles are atypical (and thus their capacity to form myelin) because unlike typical amphiphiles, their molecular structure is characterized by two hydrophilic groups (sugar, carboxylic acid) on both ends with a hydrophobic moiety in the middle. We tested three different glycolipid molecules: C18:1 sophorolipids and single-glucose C18:1 and C18:0 glucolipids, all in their nonacetylated acidic form. Neither sophorolipids (too soluble) nor C18:0 glucolipids (too insoluble) displayed myelin growth at room temperature (RT, 25 C). The glucolipid C18:1 (G-C18:1), on the other hand, showed dense myelin growth at RT below pH 7.0. Examining their growth rates, we find that they display a linear L $\alpha$ t (L, myelin length; t, time) growth rate, suggesting ballistic growth, distinctly different from the L $\alpha$ t^(1/2) dependence, characterizing diffusive growth such as what occurs in more conventional phospholipids. These results offer some insight into lipidic mesophases arising from a previously unexplored class of amphiphiles with potential applications in the field of drug delivery.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 07:50:28 UTC (1,735 KB)"

DSO iteratively updates a latent space generative model and a synthetic dataset in an optimization process that gradually shifts the generative model and the synthetic data towards regions of desired property values. Our generative model takes the form of a Latent Prompt Transformer (LPT) where the latent vector serves as the prompt of a causal transformer. Our extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed method, which sets new performance benchmarks across single-objective, multi-objective and constrained molecule design tasks.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 03:33:23 UTC (3,797 KB)"

ChangMo Yang, Chang Woo Myung","Materials Science (cond-mat.mtrl-sci)","Large-scale computer simulations of chemical atoms are used in a wide range of applications, including batteries, drugs, and more. However, there is a problem with efficiency as it takes a long time due to the large amount of calculation. To solve these problems, machine learning interatomic potential (ML-IAP) technology is attracting attention as an alternative. ML-IAP not only has high accuracy by faithfully expressing the density functional theory (DFT), but also has the advantage of low computational cost. However, there is a problem that the potential energy changes significantly depending on the environment of each atom, and expansion to a wide range of compounds within a single model is still difficult to build in the case of a kernel-based model. To solve this problem, we would like to develop a universal ML-IAP using this active Bayesian Committee Machine (BCM) potential methodology for carbon-nitrogen-hydrogen (CNH) with various compositions. ML models are trained and generated through first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations for molecules with only CNH. Using long amine structures to test an ML model trained only with short chains, the results show excellent consistency with DFT calculations. Consequently, machine learning-based models for organic molecules not only demonstrate the ability to accurately describe various physical properties but also hold promise for investigating a broad spectrum of diverse materials systems.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 01:55:41 UTC (993 KB)"

In this work, a synthesis method for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-2)-loaded PLGA NPs was developed and optimized, in order to carry out and control the release of BMP-2, based on the double-emulsion (water/oil/water,W/O/W) solvent evaporation technique. The polymeric surfactant Pluronic F68 was used in the synthesis procedure, as it is known to have an effect on the reduction of the size of the NPs, the enhancement of their stability, and the protection of the encapsulated biomolecule. Spherical solid polymeric NPs were synthesized, showing a reproducible multimodal size distribution, with diameters between 100 and 500 nm. This size range appears to allow the protein to act on the cell surface and at the cytoplasm level. The effect of carrying BMP-2 co-adsorbed with bovine serum albumin on the NP surface was analyzed. The colloidal properties of these systems (morphology by SEM, hydrodynamic size, electrophoretic mobility, temporal stability, protein encapsulation, and short-term release profile) were studied. The effect of both BMP2-loaded NPs on the proliferation, migration, and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stromal cells from human alveolar bone (ABSC) was also analyzed in vitro.","Fri, 19 Jan 2024 08:00:43 UTC (680 KB)"

Triallists wishing to choose a design require knowledge of operating characteristics of competing methods. This is often assessed using a large-scale simulation study with multiple designs and configurations investigated, which can be time-consuming and therefore limits the scope of the simulation. We introduce a new approach to the design of simulation studies of dose-finding trials. The approach simulates all potential outcomes that individuals could experience at each dose level in the trial. Datasets are simulated in advance and then the same datasets are applied to each of the competing methods to enable a more efficient head-to-head comparison. In two case-studies we show sizeable reductions in Monte Carlo error for comparing a performance metric between two competing designs. Efficiency gains depend on the similarity of the designs. Comparing two Phase I/II design variants, with high correlation of recommending the same optimal biologic dose, we show that the new approach requires a simulation study that is approximately 30 times smaller than the conventional approach. Furthermore, advance-simulated trial datasets can be reused to assess the performance of designs across multiple configurations. We recommend researchers consider this more efficient simulation approach in their dose-finding studies and we have updated the R package escalation to help facilitate implementation.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 17:37:28 UTC (689 KB)"

Existing approaches utilize Neural OT and largely rely on Brenier's theorem. Here, we propose a first-of-its-kind quantum computing formulation for amortized optimization of contextualized transportation plans. We exploit a direct link between doubly stochastic matrices and unitary operators thus finding a natural connection between OT and quantum computation. We verify our method on synthetic and real data, by predicting variations in cell type distributions parameterized through drug dosage as context. Our comparisons to several baselines reveal that our method can capture dose-induced variations in cell distributions, even to some extent when dosages are extrapolated and sometimes with performance similar to the best classical models.

As a running example, we consider predicting how different drugs affect cells from different cell types. We study the index-only setting, where the actions and contexts are categorical variables with a finite number of possible values. Even in this simple setting, a practical challenge arises, since often only a small subset of possible action-context pairs have been studied. Thus, models must extrapolate to novel action-context pairs, which can be framed as a form of matrix completion with rows indexed by actions, columns indexed by contexts, and matrix entries corresponding to outcomes. We introduce a novel SCM-based model class, where the outcome is expressed as a counterfactual, actions are expressed as interventions on an instrumental variable, and contexts are defined based on the initial state of the system. We show that, under a linearity assumption, this setup induces a latent factor model over the matrix of outcomes, with an additional fixed effect term. To perform causal prediction based on this model class, we introduce simple extension to the Synthetic Interventions estimator (Agarwal et al., 2020). We evaluate several matrix completion approaches on the PRISM drug repurposing dataset, showing that our method outperforms all other considered matrix completion approaches.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 18:37:33 UTC (6,933 KB)"

In this paper, we first synthesize mesoporous silica MCM-41 and its derivative MCM-41GA with anchored glutaraldehyde bridges, and characterize them using a variety of techniques, including nitrogen adsorption/desorption, X-ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Then, we employ random optical fields to sort mesoporous silica particles. Random optical fields by containing local intensity gradients throughout a wide range of field of view provide an elegant, easy-to-implement, and low-cost variant of multiple optical tweezers, which is known as speckle tweezers (ST). ST, similar to multiple optical tweezers, for manipulation tasks, such as trapping, sorting, and guiding of collection of micro and sub-micro objects in several disciplines including statistical physics, chemistry, microfluidics and material science. We show that ST can restrict, sieve, and sort MCM-41 and MCM-41GA particles. The different interaction of mesoporous silica variations with the applied ST may be attributed to the pre-applied modification and the differences in the porosity structure and distribution. Therefore, the results provide insight into the textural and chemical characteristics of mesoporous materials, contributing to a deeper understanding of their potential applications.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 14:21:27 UTC (7,975 KB)"

Multimodal data often warrants the use of black-box algorithms, for instance, random forests or neural networks, which impede the use of traditional variable significance tests. We address this problem by proposing the use of COvariance Measure Tests (COMETs), which are calibrated and powerful tests that can be combined with any sufficiently predictive supervised learning algorithm. We apply COMETs to several high-dimensional, multimodal data sets to illustrate (i) variable significance testing for finding relevant mutations modulating drug-activity, (ii) modality selection for predicting survival in liver cancer patients with multiomics data, and (iii) modality selection with clinical features and medical imaging data. In all applications, COMETs yield results consistent with domain knowledge without requiring data-driven pre-processing which may invalidate type I error control. These novel applications with high-dimensional multimodal data corroborate prior results on the power and robustness of COMETs for significance testing.

Existing methods either use conditional generative model to learn the distribution of 3D ligands given target binding sites, or iteratively modify molecules to optimize a structure-based activity estimator. The former is highly constrained by data quantity and quality, which leaves optimization-based approaches more promising in practical scenario. However, existing optimization-based approaches choose to edit molecules in 2D space, and use molecular docking to estimate the activity using docking predicted 3D target-ligand complexes. The misalignment between the action space and the objective hinders the performance of these models, especially for those employ deep learning for acceleration.

These large-scale clinical data, collectively referred to as ""real-world data (RWD)"". It is expected to be widely used in large-scale observational studies of specific diseases, personal medicine or precise medicine, finding the responder of drugs or treatments. Applying RWD for estimating heterogeneous treat ment effect (HTE) has already been a trending topic. HTE has the potential to considerably impact the development of precision medicine by helping doctors make more informed precise treatment decisions and provide more personalized medical care. The statistical models used to estimate HTE is called treatment effect models. Powers et al. proposed a some treatment effect models for observational study, where they pointed out that the bagging causal MARS (BCM) performs outstanding compared to other models.

However, when applied to molecular representation learning (MRL), prevailing techniques such as masked sub-unit reconstruction often fall short, due to the high degree of freedom in the possible combinations of atoms within molecules, which brings insurmountable complexity to the masking-reconstruction paradigm. To tackle this challenge, we introduce REMO, a self-supervised learning framework that takes advantage of well-defined atom-combination rules in common chemistry. Specifically, REMO pre-trains graph/Transformer encoders on 1.7 million known chemical reactions in the literature. We propose two pre-training objectives: Masked Reaction Centre Reconstruction (MRCR) and Reaction Centre Identification (RCI). REMO offers a novel solution to MRL by exploiting the underlying shared patterns in chemical reactions as \textit{context} for pre-training, which effectively infers meaningful representations of common chemistry knowledge. Such contextual representations can then be utilized to support diverse downstream molecular tasks with minimum finetuning, such as affinity prediction and drug-drug interaction prediction. Extensive experimental results on MoleculeACE, ACNet, drug-drug interaction (DDI), and reaction type classification show that across all tested downstream tasks, REMO outperforms the standard baseline of single-molecule masked modeling used in current MRL. Remarkably, REMO is the pioneering deep learning model surpassing fingerprint-based methods in activity cliff benchmarks.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 12:58:40 UTC (1,502 KB)"

Although the existing literature on deposition in straight tubes is quite mature, an experimental study on deposition in micro capillaries with a wide ranges of Re that models particle dynamics in lungs, is missing. The deposition of atmospheric pollutants and nebulized drugs in the lung depends on various biological factors such as flow properties, lung morphology, breathing patterns, particle properties, deposition mechanism, etc. To complicate matters, each breath manifests flows spanning a wide range of Reynolds numbers in various regions of the lung. In this study, the deposition of nebulized aerosol was experimentally investigated in phantom bronchioles of diameters relevant to the 7th to the 23rd branching generations and over the entire range of Re manifest during one breathing cycle. The aerosol fluid was loaded with boron doped carbon quantum dots as a fluorophore. An aerosol was generated of this mixture fluid using an ultrasonic nebulizer, producing droplets of 6.5$\mu$m as the mean diameter. The amount of aerosol deposited on the bronchiole walls was measured using a spectrofluorometer.

Identifying named entities (e.g., diseases, drugs, or genes) in texts and their linkage to reference knowledge bases are crucial steps in BTM pipelines to enable information aggregation from different documents. However, tools for these two steps are rarely applied in the same context in which they were developed. Instead, they are applied in the wild, i.e., on application-dependent text collections different from those used for the tools' training, varying, e.g., in focus, genre, style, and text type. This raises the question of whether the reported performance of BTM tools can be trusted for downstream applications. Here, we report on the results of a carefully designed cross-corpus benchmark for named entity extraction, where tools were applied systematically to corpora not used during their training. Based on a survey of 28 published systems, we selected five for an in-depth analysis on three publicly available corpora encompassing four different entity types. Comparison between tools results in a mixed picture and shows that, in a cross-corpus setting, the performance is significantly lower than the one reported in an in-corpus setting. HunFlair2 showed the best performance on average, being closely followed by PubTator. Our results indicate that users of BTM tools should expect diminishing performances when applying them in the wild compared to original publications and show that further research is necessary to make BTM tools more robust.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 18:58:18 UTC (4,671 KB)[v2] Tue, 20 Feb 2024 13:10:27 UTC (4,671 KB)"

Yet, LLMs are prone to highlight the most frequently seen pieces of information from the training set and to neglect the rare ones. In the field of biomedical research, latest discoveries are key to academic and industrial actors and are obscured by the abundance of an ever-increasing literature corpus (the information overload problem). Surfacing new associations between biomedical entities, e.g., drugs, genes, diseases, with LLMs becomes a challenge of capturing the long-tail knowledge of the biomedical scientific production. To overcome this challenge, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to alleviate some of the shortcomings of LLMs by augmenting the prompts with context retrieved from external datasets. RAG methods typically select the context via maximum similarity search over text embeddings. In this study, we show that RAG methods leave out a significant proportion of relevant information due to clusters of over-represented concepts in the biomedical literature. We introduce a novel information-retrieval method that leverages a knowledge graph to downsample these clusters and mitigate the information overload problem. Its retrieval performance is about twice better than embedding similarity alternatives on both precision and recall. Finally, we demonstrate that both embedding similarity and knowledge graph retrieval methods can be advantageously combined into a hybrid model that outperforms both, enabling potential improvements to biomedical question-answering models.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 18:31:11 UTC (653 KB)"

In this work, we consider an alternative frequentist approach to colocalization testing that examines the proportionality of genetic associations with each trait. The proportional colocalization approach uses markedly different assumptions to Bayesian colocalization tests, and therefore can provide valuable complementary evidence in cases where Bayesian colocalization results are inconclusive or sensitive to priors. We propose a novel conditional test of proportional colocalization, prop-coloc-cond, that aims to account for the uncertainty in variant selection, in order to recover accurate type I error control. The test can be implemented straightforwardly, requiring only summary data on genetic associations. Simulation evidence and an empirical investigation into GLP1R gene expression demonstrates how tests of proportional colocalization can offer important insights in conjunction with Bayesian colocalization tests.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 14:25:09 UTC (4,905 KB)"
"73","A novel molecule generative model of VAE combined with Transformer","Yasuhiro Yoshikai, Tadahaya Mizuno, Shumpei Nemoto, Hiroyuki Kusuhara","Biomolecules (q-bio.BM)","Recently, molecule generation using deep learning has been actively investigated in drug discovery. In this field, Transformer and VAE are widely used as powerful models, but they are rarely used in combination due to structural and performance mismatch of them. This study proposes a model that combines these two models through structural and parameter optimization in handling diverse molecules. The proposed model shows comparable performance to existing models in generating molecules, and showed by far superior performance in generating molecules with unseen structures. In addition, the proposed model successfully predicted molecular properties using the latent representation of VAE. Ablation studies suggested the advantage of VAE over other generative models like language model in generating novel molecules, and that the molecules can be described by ~32 dimensional variables, much smaller than existing descriptors and models. This study is expected to provide a virtual chemical library containing a wide variety of compounds for virtual screening and to enable efficient screening.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 08:46:04 UTC (874 KB)"

However, they are still hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the issue of highly imbalanced event distribution, which is a common but critical problem in medical datasets where certain interactions are vastly underrepresented. This imbalance poses a substantial barrier to achieving accurate and reliable DDI predictions. (2) the scarcity of labeled data for rare events, which is a pervasive issue in the medical field where rare yet potentially critical interactions are often overlooked or under-studied due to limited available data. In response, we offer DDIPrompt, an innovative panacea inspired by the recent advancements in graph prompting. Our framework aims to address these issues by leveraging the intrinsic knowledge from pre-trained models, which can be efficiently deployed with minimal downstream data. Specifically, to solve the first challenge, DDIPrompt employs augmented links between drugs, considering both structural and interactive proximity. It features a hierarchical pre-training strategy that comprehends intra-molecular structures and inter-molecular interactions, fostering a comprehensive and unbiased understanding of drug properties. For the second challenge, we implement a prototype-enhanced prompting mechanism during inference. This mechanism, refined by few-shot examples from each category, effectively harnesses the rich pre-training knowledge to enhance prediction accuracy, particularly for these rare but crucial interactions. Comprehensive evaluations on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of DDIPrompt, particularly in predicting rare DDI events.","Sun, 18 Feb 2024 06:22:01 UTC (2,974 KB)"

To fill these gaps, we introduce an under-explored task, named flexible docking to predict poses of ligand and pocket sidechains simultaneously and introduce Re-Dock, a novel diffusion bridge generative model extended to geometric manifolds. Specifically, we propose energy-to-geometry mapping inspired by the Newton-Euler equation to co-model the binding energy and conformations for reflecting the energy-constrained docking generative process.

The prediction horizon is in this case an important parameter in order to fulfill the pharmacokinetics of medications, or the time response of medical services. This paper presents a study about the prediction limits of a chronic disease with symptomatic crises: the migraine. For that purpose, this work develops a methodology to build predictive migraine models and to improve these predictions beyond the limits of the initial models. The maximum prediction horizon is analyzed, and its dependency on the selected features is studied. A strategy for model selection is proposed to tackle the trade off between conservative but robust predictive models, with respect to less accurate predictions with higher horizons. The obtained results show a prediction horizon close to 40 minutes, which is in the time range of the drug pharmacokinetics. Experiments have been performed in a realistic scenario where input data have been acquired in an ambulatory clinical study by the deployment of a non-intrusive Wireless Body Sensor Network. Our results provide an effective methodology for the selection of the future horizon in the development of prediction algorithms for diseases experiencing symptomatic crises.","Thu, 15 Feb 2024 08:30:50 UTC (6,445 KB)"

However, such models are often not useful in practice because even compounds with high docking scores do not consistently show experimental activity. More accurate methods for activity prediction exist, such as molecular dynamics based binding free energy calculations, but they are too computationally expensive to use in a generative model. We propose a multi-fidelity approach, Multi-Fidelity Bind (MFBind), to achieve the optimal trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. MFBind integrates docking and binding free energy simulators to train a multi-fidelity deep surrogate model with active learning. Our deep surrogate model utilizes a pretraining technique and linear prediction heads to efficiently fit small amounts of high-fidelity data.

They were initially discovered by F.W. Twort and later on, Felix d'Herelle unveiled them to the world in 1910. Phage therapy has arisen as a favorable option to conventional antibiotics by reducing the multinational problem of increasing antibacterial resistance. These virulent viruses particularly prey on and contaminate bacterial strains and aid in fighting bacterial diseases. Researchers are performing various clinical trials on the bacteriophage to tackle pathogenic bacterial infections, varying from typical illnesses to highly invulnerable biofilms that cannot be treated with antibiotics. The primary experiments demonstrated that phage therapy has fewer consequences than traditional antimicrobial drugs. It is safer to use and show results within a few days. Although phage therapy has a wide range of promising results, but it also encounters diverse obstacles. One is that they are host-specific and can merely be used for personalized therapy. As thousands of bacteria can cause disease, clinicians have to construct a library of phage viruses. For successful treatment, an analysis of versatility, stability, and immune interference related to bacteriophage is necessary. Phage therapy is an excellent substitute for antibiotics as it illustrates a living base for the treatment of infections and it is climate-friendly. It only targets the pathogenic cells and has less influence on the normal microbiota. Regardless of the challenges and problems, phage therapy is approved as a beneficial approach to combating contagious infections.","Thu, 15 Feb 2024 07:05:33 UTC (458 KB)"

In this paper, we analyze hashtag drifts over time using concepts from graph analysis and textual data streams using the Girvan-Newman method to uncover hashtag communities in annual snapshots. More specifically, we analyzed the #mybodymychoice hashtag between 2018 and 2022. In addition, we offer insights about some hashtags found in the study. Furthermore, our approach can be useful for monitoring changes over time in opinions and sentiment patterns about an entity on social media. Even though the hashtag #mybodymychoice was initially coupled with women's rights, abortion, and bodily autonomy, we observe that it suffered drifts during the studied period across topics such as drug legalization, vaccination, political protests, war, and civil rights.

This task often presents significant challenges when (i) observations are limited to cross-sectional samples (where individual trajectories are inaccessible for learning), and moreover, (ii) the behaviors of individual particles are heterogeneous (especially in biological systems due to biodiversity). To address them, we introduce a novel framework dubbed correlational Lagrangian Schrödinger bridge (CLSB), aiming to seek for the evolution ""bridging"" among cross-sectional observations, while regularized for the minimal population ""cost"". In contrast to prior methods relying on \textit{individual}-level regularizers for all particles \textit{homogeneously} (e.g. restraining individual motions), CLSB operates at the population level admitting the heterogeneity nature, resulting in a more generalizable modeling in practice. To this end, our contributions include (1) a new class of population regularizers capturing the temporal variations in multivariate relations, with the tractable formulation derived, (2) three domain-informed instantiations based on genetic co-expression stability, and (3) an integration of population regularizers into data-driven generative models as constrained optimization, and a numerical solution, with further extension to conditional generative models. Empirically, we demonstrate the superiority of CLSB in single-cell sequencing data analyses such as simulating cell development over time and predicting cellular responses to drugs of varied doses.","Sun, 4 Feb 2024 19:33:44 UTC (4,797 KB)"

Every approved drug has an indication, which refers to the therapeutic use of that drug for treating a particular medical condition. While the Large Language Model (LLM), a generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique, has recently demonstrated effectiveness in translating between molecules and their textual descriptions, there remains a gap in research regarding their application in facilitating the translation between drug molecules and indications, or vice versa, which could greatly benefit the drug discovery process. The capability of generating a drug from a given indication would allow for the discovery of drugs targeting specific diseases or targets and ultimately provide patients with better treatments.

Common methodologies in partially-observable domains largely lean on end-to-end learning from high-dimensional observations, such as images, without explicitly reasoning about true state. We suggest an alternative direction, introducing the Partially Supervised Reinforcement Learning (PSRL) framework. At the heart of PSRL is the fusion of both supervised and unsupervised learning. The approach leverages a state estimator to distill supervised semantic state information from high-dimensional observations which are often fully observable at training time. This yields more interpretable policies that compose state predictions with control. In parallel, it captures an unsupervised latent representation. These two-the semantic state and the latent state-are then fused and utilized as inputs to a policy network. This juxtaposition offers practitioners a flexible and dynamic spectrum: from emphasizing supervised state information to integrating richer, latent insights. Extensive experimental results indicate that by merging these dual representations, PSRL offers a potent balance, enhancing model interpretability while preserving, and often significantly outperforming, the performance benchmarks set by traditional methods in terms of reward and convergence speed.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 16:23:23 UTC (4,673 KB)"

Examples: We apply the Model Facts template on two previously published models, a violence risk identification model and a suicide risk prediction model. We demonstrate the ease of accessing the appropriate information when the data is structured appropriately. Discussion: The Model Facts template is limited in its current form to human based data and biases.

A promising device, automated drug dispensing systems (ADDSs), has emerged to streamline these processes. These systems involve human order pickers who are assisted by ADDSs. The ADDS's robotic arm transports bins from storage locations to the input/output (I/O) points, while the pharmacist sorts the requested drugs from the bins at the I/O points. This paper focuses on coordinating the ADDS and the pharmacists to optimize the order-picking strategy. Another critical aspect of order-picking systems is the storage location assignment problem (SLAP), which determines the allocation of drugs to storage locations. In this study, we consider the ADDS as a smart warehouse and propose a two-stage scattered storage and clustered allocation (SSCA) strategy to optimize the SLAP for ADDSs. The first stage primarily adopts a scattered storage approach, and we develop a mathematical programming model to group drugs accordingly. In the second stage, we introduce a sequential alternating (SA) heuristic algorithm that takes into account the drug demand frequency and the correlation between drugs to cluster and locate them effectively. To evaluate the proposed SSCA strategy, we develop a double objective integer programming model for the order-picking problem in ADDSs to minimize the number of machines visited in prescription orders while maintaining the shortest average picking time of orders. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can optimize the SLAP in ADDSs and improve significantly the order-picking efficiency of ADDSs in a human-robot cooperation environment.","Mon, 18 Dec 2023 16:05:20 UTC (849 KB)"

We consider a two-stage test procedure, in which the weighting of the log-rank test statistic depends on a pre-test of the proportional hazards assumption. I.e., depending on the pre-test either the log-rank or an alternative test is used to compare the survival probabilities. We show that if naively implemented this can lead to a substantial inflation of the type-I error rate. To address this, we embed the two-stage test in a permutation test framework to keep the nominal level alpha.

Researchers have increasingly leveraged novel computational techniques to streamline the drug development process to increase hit rates and reduce the costs associated with bringing a drug to market. To this end, we introduce a quantum-classical generative model that seamlessly integrates the computational power of quantum algorithms trained on a 16-qubit IBM quantum computer with the established reliability of classical methods for designing small molecules. Our hybrid generative model was applied to designing new KRAS inhibitors, a crucial target in cancer therapy. We synthesized 15 promising molecules during our investigation and subjected them to experimental testing to assess their ability to engage with the target. Notably, among these candidates, two molecules, ISM061-018-2 and ISM061-22, each featuring unique scaffolds, stood out by demonstrating effective engagement with KRAS. ISM061-018-2 was identified as a broad-spectrum KRAS inhibitor, exhibiting a binding affinity to KRAS-G12D at $1.4 \mu M$. Concurrently, ISM061-22 exhibited specific mutant selectivity, displaying heightened activity against KRAS G12R and Q61H mutants. To our knowledge, this work shows for the first time the use of a quantum-generative model to yield experimentally confirmed biological hits, showcasing the practical potential of quantum-assisted drug discovery to produce viable therapeutics. Moreover, our findings reveal that the efficacy of distribution learning correlates with the number of qubits utilized, underlining the scalability potential of quantum computing resources. Overall, we anticipate our results to be a stepping stone towards developing more advanced quantum generative models in drug discovery.","Tue, 13 Feb 2024 04:19:06 UTC (25,482 KB)"

Li","Biomolecules (q-bio.BM)","Compound-Protein Interaction (CPI) prediction aims to predict the pattern and strength of compound-protein interactions for rational drug discovery. Existing deep learning-based methods utilize only the single modality of protein sequences or structures and lack the co-modeling of the joint distribution of the two modalities, which may lead to significant performance drops in complex real-world scenarios due to various factors, e.g., modality missing and domain shifting. More importantly, these methods only model protein sequences and structures at a single fixed scale, neglecting more fine-grained multi-scale information, such as those embedded in key protein fragments. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale Protein Sequence-structure Contrasting framework for CPI prediction (PSC-CPI), which captures the dependencies between protein sequences and structures through both intra-modality and cross-modality contrasting. We further apply length-variable protein augmentation to allow contrasting to be performed at different scales, from the amino acid level to the sequence level. Finally, in order to more fairly evaluate the model generalizability, we split the test data into four settings based on whether compounds and proteins have been observed during the training stage. Extensive experiments have shown that PSC-CPI generalizes well in all four settings, particularly in the more challenging ``Unseen-Both"" setting, where neither compounds nor proteins have been observed during training. Furthermore, even when encountering a situation of modality missing, i.e., inference with only single-modality protein data, PSC-CPI still exhibits comparable or even better performance than previous approaches.","Tue, 13 Feb 2024 03:51:10 UTC (1,432 KB)"

Popov, Shawn Gomez, Alexander Tropsha","Information Retrieval (cs.IR)","Nearest neighbor-based similarity searching is a common task in chemistry, with notable use cases in drug discovery. Yet, some of the most commonly used approaches for this task still leverage a brute-force approach. In practice this can be computationally costly and overly time-consuming, due in part to the sheer size of modern chemical databases. Previous computational advancements for this task have generally relied on improvements to hardware or dataset-specific tricks that lack generalizability. Approaches that leverage lower-complexity searching algorithms remain relatively underexplored. However, many of these algorithms are approximate solutions and/or struggle with typical high-dimensional chemical embeddings. Here we evaluate whether a combination of low-dimensional chemical embeddings and a k-d tree data structure can achieve fast nearest neighbor queries while maintaining performance on standard chemical similarity search benchmarks. We examine different dimensionality reductions of standard chemical embeddings as well as a learned, structurally-aware embedding -- SmallSA -- for this task. With this framework, searches on over one billion chemicals execute in less than a second on a single CPU core, five orders of magnitude faster than the brute-force approach. We also demonstrate that SmallSA achieves competitive performance on chemical similarity benchmarks.","Mon, 12 Feb 2024 18:24:32 UTC (1,431 KB)"

This model is established considering the interplay between uninfected cells, infected cells, capsids, and viruses. Three drugs are considered for specific roles (i) pegylated interferon (PEG IFN) for immune modulation, (ii) lamivudine (LMV) as a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor, and (iii) entecavir (ETV) to block capsid recycling. Using these drugs, three combination therapies are introduced, specifically CT PEG IFN plus LMV, CT PEG IFN plus ETV, and CT PEG IFN plus LMV plus ETV. As a result, when LMV is used in combination therapy with PEG IFN and ETV, the impacts of ETV become insignificant. In conclusion, if the appropriate drug effectively inhibits reverse transcription, there is no need for an additional inhibitor to block capsid recycling.","Mon, 12 Feb 2024 15:08:49 UTC (213 KB)"

The receptor-hopping protocol, where a ligand is alchemically transferred from one receptor to another in one simulation, directly yields the ligand's binding selectivity free energy for the two receptors, which is the difference between the two binding free energies. In the ligand-swapping protocol, the first ligand of a pair is transferred from one receptor to another while the second ligand is simultaneously transferred in the opposite direction. The ligand-swapping free energy yields the differences in binding selectivity free energies of a set of ligands, which, when combined using a generalized DiffNet algorithm, yield the binding selectivity free energies of the ligands. We test these novel algorithms on host-guest systems and show that they yield results values in good agreement with experimental data and consistent with differences of absolute and relative binding free energies obtained by conventional methods.

Therefore, the development of clinical trial outcome prediction models aims to exclude drugs likely to fail and holds the potential for significant cost savings. Recent data-driven attempts leverage deep learning methods to integrate multimodal data for predicting clinical trial outcomes. However, these approaches rely on manually designed modal-specific encoders, which limits both the extensibility to adapt new modalities and the ability to discern similar information patterns across different modalities. To address these issues, we propose a multimodal mixture-of-experts (LIFTED) approach for clinical trial outcome prediction. Specifically, LIFTED unifies different modality data by transforming them into natural language descriptions. Then, LIFTED constructs unified noise-resilient encoders to extract information from modal-specific language descriptions. Subsequently, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework is employed to further refine the representations, enabling LIFTED to identify similar information patterns across different modalities and extract more consistent representations from those patterns using the same expert model. Finally, a mixture-of-experts module is further employed to dynamically integrate different modality representations for prediction, which gives LIFTED the ability to automatically weigh different modalities and pay more attention to critical information. The experiments demonstrate that LIFTED significantly enhances performance in predicting clinical trial outcomes across all three phases compared to the best baseline, showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed key components.","Fri, 9 Feb 2024 16:18:38 UTC (1,373 KB)[v2] Sun, 18 Feb 2024 04:56:03 UTC (1,375 KB)"

Electro-Magnetic Navigation Systems (eMNSs) are believed to have a superior actuation bandwidth, facilitating trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection. This greatly expands the range of potential medical applications and includes even dynamic environments as encountered in cardiovascular interventions. In order to highlight the dynamic capabilities of eMNSs, we successfully stabilize a (non-magnetic) inverted pendulum on the tip of a magnetically driven arm. Our method employs a model-based design approach, where we capture the dynamics that describe the interaction of the pendulum system and the magnetic field through Lagrangian mechanics. Using system identification we estimate the system parameters, the actuation bandwidth, and characterize the system's nonlinearity. We design a state-feedback controller to stabilize the inherently unstable dynamics, and compensate for errors arising from the calibration of the magnetic field and the angle measurement system. Additionally, we integrate an iterative learning control scheme that allows us to accurately track non-equilibrium trajectories while concurrently maintaining stability of the inverted pendulum.

However, their capabilities wane in highly specialized domains underrepresented in the pretraining corpus, such as physical and biomedical sciences. This work explores how to repurpose general LLMs into effective task solvers for specialized domains. We introduce a novel, model-agnostic framework for learning custom input tags, which are parameterized as continuous vectors appended to the LLM's embedding layer, to condition the LLM. We design two types of input tags: domain tags are used to delimit specialized representations (e.g., chemical formulas) and provide domain-relevant context; function tags are used to represent specific functions (e.g., predicting molecular properties) and compress function-solving instructions. We develop a three-stage protocol to learn these tags using auxiliary data and domain knowledge. By explicitly disentangling task domains from task functions, our method enables zero-shot generalization to unseen problems through diverse combinations of the input tags. It also boosts LLM's performance in various specialized domains, such as predicting protein or chemical properties and modeling drug-target interactions, outperforming expert models tailored to these tasks.","Tue, 6 Feb 2024 20:11:54 UTC (1,320 KB)"

In this work, we explore their application to trial matching. First, we design an LLM-based system which, given a patient's medical history as unstructured clinical text, evaluates whether that patient meets a set of inclusion criteria (also specified as free text). Our zero-shot system achieves state-of-the-art scores on the n2c2 2018 cohort selection benchmark.

Third, we evaluate the interpretability of our system by having clinicians evaluate the natural language justifications generated by the LLM for each eligibility decision, and show that it can output coherent explanations for 97% of its correct decisions and 75% of its incorrect ones.

In this study, the jet penetration depth in a soft material-which is a critical parameter for practical needle-free injections-was investigated. We conducted jet penetration experiments by varying the inner diameter of the injection tube and the standoff distance between the meniscus surface and the soft material. Interestingly, the results showed that the penetration depths peaked at certain distances from the meniscus, and the positions shifted further away as the inner diameter was increased. By analyzing the velocity distribution of the microjet, the peak positions of the penetration depth and the maximum velocities were inconsistent due to the effects of the jet shape. To account for this, we introduce the concept of the 'jet pressure impulse', a physical quantity that unifies the velocity and jet shape. However, direct estimation of this parameter from experimental data is challenging due to limitations in spatiotemporal resolution. Therefore, we used numerical simulations to replicate the experimental conditions and calculate the jet pressure impulse. Remarkably, the results show that the jet pressure impulse has peak values, which is consistent with the penetration depth. In addition, there is a correlation between the magnitude of the jet pressure impulse and the penetration depth, highlighting its importance as a key parameter. This study underlines the importance of the jet pressure impulse in controlling the penetration depth of a focused microjet, providing valuable insights for the practical use of needle-free injection techniques.","Wed, 7 Feb 2024 03:01:54 UTC (7,038 KB)"

The existing methodologies in the field primarily concentrate on constructing models that capture the relationship between utility function values and subsets within their respective supersets. However, these approaches tend to overlook the valuable information contained within the superset when utilizing neural networks to model set functions. In this work, we address this oversight by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Our theoretical findings demonstrate that when the target value is conditioned on both the input set and subset, it is essential to incorporate an \textit{invariant sufficient statistic} of the superset into the subset of interest for effective learning. This ensures that the output value remains invariant to permutations of the subset and its corresponding superset, enabling identification of the specific superset from which the subset originated. Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective information aggregation module designed to merge the representations of subsets and supersets from a permutation invariance perspective. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across diverse tasks and datasets validate the enhanced efficacy of our approach over conventional methods, underscoring the practicality and potency of our proposed strategies in real-world contexts.","Mon, 5 Feb 2024 16:09:35 UTC (4,876 KB)"

Unfortunately, many sophisticated models currently in use tend to overlook the nuanced semantics of medical data, while only relying heavily on identities. Furthermore, these models face significant challenges in handling cases involving patients who are visiting the hospital for the first time, as they lack prior prescription histories to draw upon. To tackle these issues, we harness the powerful semantic comprehension and input-agnostic characteristics of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our research aims to transform existing medication recommendation methodologies using LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Large Language Model Distilling Medication Recommendation (LEADER). We begin by creating appropriate prompt templates that enable LLMs to suggest medications effectively. However, the straightforward integration of LLMs into recommender systems leads to an out-of-corpus issue specific to drugs. We handle it by adapting the LLMs with a novel output layer and a refined tuning loss function. Although LLM-based models exhibit remarkable capabilities, they are plagued by high computational costs during inference, which is impractical for the healthcare sector. To mitigate this, we have developed a feature-level knowledge distillation technique, which transfers the LLM's proficiency to a more compact model. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrate that our proposed model not only delivers effective results but also is efficient. To ease the reproducibility of our experiments, we release the implementation code online.","Mon, 5 Feb 2024 08:25:22 UTC (954 KB)"

Astrocytes differentiated from iPSCs are important targets to investigate neuronal metabolism. The astrocyte differentiation progress can be monitored through the variations of morphology observed from microscopy images at different differentiation stages, then determined by molecular biology techniques upon maturation. However, the astrocytes usually ``perfectly'' blend into the background and some of them are covered by interference information (i.e., dead cells, media sediments, and cell debris), which makes astrocytes difficult to observe. Due to the lack of annotated datasets, the existing state-of-the-art deep learning approaches cannot be used to address this issue. In this paper, we introduce a new task named astrocyte segmentation with a novel dataset, called IAI704, which contains 704 images and their corresponding pixel-level annotation masks. Moreover, a novel frequency domain denoising network, named FDNet, is proposed for astrocyte segmentation. In detail, our FDNet consists of a contextual information fusion module (CIF), an attention block (AB), and a Fourier transform block (FTB). CIF and AB fuse multi-scale feature embeddings to localize the astrocytes. FTB transforms feature embeddings into the frequency domain and conducts a high-pass filter to eliminate interference information. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed FDNet over the state-of-the-art substitutes in astrocyte segmentation, shedding insights for iPSC differentiation progress prediction.","Mon, 5 Feb 2024 04:45:24 UTC (2,462 KB)"

Benkherouf","Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)","Insomnia often requires pharmacological interventions, with benzodiazepines and Z-drugs enhancing GABA's inhibitory effects by stabilizing GABAA receptor chloride ion channels. Prolonged use, however, raises dependency and cognitive concerns. Humulus lupulus (hops) is gaining attention as a natural relaxant and sleep aid, potentially modulating GABAA receptors differently. This study explores hops' neuroactive phytochemicals and their therapeutic mechanisms. The alpha-acid humulone and hop prenylflavonoids affect GABA-induced displacement of [3H]EBOB in the GABAA receptor, showing flumazenil-insensitive and subtype-selective effects. Molecular docking identifies binding sites, with humulone's activity confirmed electrophysiologically and in mouse studies, impacting sleep onset and duration.

It is crucial to incorporate diverse molecular relationships characterized by multi-similarity (self-similarity and relative similarities) between molecules. However, current molecular representation learning methods fall short in exploring multi-similarity and often underestimate the complexity of relationships between molecules. Additionally, previous multi-similarity approaches require the specification of positive and negative pairs to attribute distinct predefined weights to different relative similarities, which can introduce potential bias. In this work, we introduce Graph Multi-Similarity Learning for Molecular Property Prediction (GraphMSL) framework, along with a novel approach to formulate a generalized multi-similarity metric without the need to define positive and negative pairs. In each of the chemical modality spaces (e.g.,molecular depiction image, fingerprint, NMR, and SMILES) under consideration, we first define a self-similarity metric (i.e., similarity between an anchor molecule and another molecule), and then transform it into a generalized multi-similarity metric for the anchor through a pair weighting function. GraphMSL validates the efficacy of the multi-similarity metric across MoleculeNet datasets. Furthermore, these metrics of all modalities are integrated into a multimodal multi-similarity metric, which showcases the potential to improve the performance. Moreover, the focus of the model can be redirected or customized by altering the fusion function. Last but not least, GraphMSL proves effective in drug discovery evaluations through post-hoc analyses of the learnt representations.","Wed, 31 Jan 2024 05:59:38 UTC (1,595 KB)[v2] Fri, 2 Feb 2024 05:04:21 UTC (1,764 KB)"

Within the same trial multiple end-points may also be considered. For example, overall and progression-free survival time for different drugs in oncology studies. A common challenge is when an intervention is only effective for some proportion of the population who are not clinically identifiable. Therefore, latent group membership as well as separate survival models for groups identified need to be estimated. However, follow-up in trials may be relatively short leading to substantial censoring. We present a general Bayesian hierarchical framework that can handle this complexity by exploiting the similarity of cure fractions between end-points; accounting for the correlation between them and improving the extrapolation beyond the observed data. Assuming exchangeability between cure fractions facilitates the borrowing of information between end-points. We show the benefits of using our approach with a motivating example, the CheckMate 067 phase 3 trial consisting of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with first line therapy.","Wed, 24 Jan 2024 21:35:45 UTC (10,881 KB)"
"142","The assessment of replicability using the sum of p-values","Leonhard Held, Samuel Pawel, Charlotte Micheloud","Applications (stat.AP)","Statistical significance of both the original and the replication study is a commonly used criterion to assess replication attempts, also known as the two-trials rule in drug development. However, replication studies are sometimes conducted although the original study is non-significant, in which case Type-I error rate control across both studies is no longer guaranteed. We propose an alternative method to assess replicability using the sum of p-values from the two studies. The approach provides a combined p-value and can be calibrated to control the overall Type-I error rate at the same level as the two-trials rule but allows for replication success even if the original study is non-significant. The unweighted version requires a less restrictive level of significance at replication if the original study is already convincing which facilitates sample size reductions of up to 10%. Downweighting the original study accounts for possible bias and requires a more stringent significance level and larger samples sizes at replication. Data from four large-scale replication projects are used to illustrate and compare the proposed method with the two-trials rule, meta-analysis and Fisher's combination method.","Wed, 24 Jan 2024 17:43:55 UTC (137 KB)"
"143","TEPI: Taxonomy-aware Embedding and Pseudo-Imaging for Scarcely-labeled Zero-shot Genome Classification","Sathyanarayanan Aakur, Vishalini R. Laguduva, Priyadharsini Ramamurthy, Akhilesh Ramachandran","Genomics (q-bio.GN)","A species' genetic code or genome encodes valuable evolutionary, biological, and phylogenetic information that aids in species recognition, taxonomic classification, and understanding genetic predispositions like drug resistance and virulence. However, the vast number of potential species poses significant challenges in developing a general-purpose whole genome classification tool. Traditional bioinformatics tools have made notable progress but lack scalability and are computationally expensive. Machine learning-based frameworks show promise but must address the issue of large classification vocabularies with long-tail distributions. In this study, we propose addressing this problem through zero-shot learning using TEPI, Taxonomy-aware Embedding and Pseudo-Imaging. We represent each genome as pseudo-images and map them to a taxonomy-aware embedding space for reasoning and classification. This embedding space captures compositional and phylogenetic relationships of species, enabling predictions in extensive search spaces. We evaluate TEPI using two rigorous zero-shot settings and demonstrate its generalization capabilities qualitatively on curated, large-scale, publicly sourced data.","Wed, 24 Jan 2024 04:16:28 UTC (2,733 KB)"

Complex and dynamic binding processes between proteins and small molecules require searching and sampling over a wide spatial range. Traditional docking by searching for possible binding sites and conformations is computationally complex and results poorly under blind docking. Quantum-inspired algorithms combining quantum properties and annealing show great advantages in solving combinatorial optimization problems. Inspired by this, we achieve an improved in blind docking by using quantum-inspired combined with gradients learned by deep learning in the encoded molecular space. Numerical simulation shows that our method outperforms traditional docking algorithms and deep learning-based algorithms over 10\%. Compared to the current state-of-the-art deep learning-based docking algorithm DiffDock, the success rate of Top-1 (RMSD<2) achieves an improvement from 33\% to 35\% in our same setup. In particular, a 6\% improvement is realized in the high-precision region(RMSD<1) on molecules data unseen in DiffDock, which demonstrates the well-generalized of our method.","Mon, 22 Jan 2024 09:16:41 UTC (264 KB)[v2] Thu, 22 Feb 2024 02:56:06 UTC (264 KB)"
"145","A dynamic model to study the potential TB infections and assessment of control strategies in China","Chuanqing Xu, Kedeng Cheng, Songbai Guo, Dehui Yuan, Xiaoyu Zhao","Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)","China is one of the countries with a high burden of tuberculosis, and although the number of new cases of tuberculosis has been decreasing year by year, the number of new infections per year has remained high and the diagnosis rate of tuberculosis-infected patients has remained low. Based on the analysis of TB infection data, we develop a model of TB transmission dynamics that include potentially infected individuals and BCG vaccination, fit the model parameters to the data on new TB cases, calculate the basic reproduction number \mathcal{R}_v= 0.4442. A parametric sensitivity analysis of \mathcal{R}_v is performed, and we obtained the correlation coefficients of BCG vaccination rate and effectiveness rate with \mathcal{R}_v as -0.810, -0.825. According to the model, we estimate that there are 614,186 (95% CI [562,631,665,741]) potentially infected TB cases in China, accounting for about 39.5% of the total number of TB cases. We assess the feasibility of achieving the goals of the WHO strategy to end tuberculosis in China and find that reducing the number of new cases by 90 per cent by 2035 is very difficult with the current tuberculosis control measures. However, with an effective combination of control measures such as increased detection of potentially infected persons, improved drug treatment, and reduction of overall exposure to tuberculosis patients, it is feasible to reach the WHO strategic goal of ending tuberculosis by 2035.","Tue, 23 Jan 2024 03:21:49 UTC (1,426 KB)[v2] Thu, 25 Jan 2024 07:12:47 UTC (1,427 KB)"
"146","Machine Learning Modeling Of SiRNA Structure-Potency Relationship With Applications Against Sars-Cov-2 Spike Gene","Damilola Oshunyinka","Biomolecules (q-bio.BM)","The pharmaceutical Research and development (R&D) process is lengthy and costly, taking nearly a decade to bring a new drug to the market. However, advancements in biotechnology, computational methods, and machine learning algorithms have the potential to revolutionize drug discovery, speeding up the process and improving patient outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated and deepened the recognition of the potential of these techniques, especially in the areas of drug repurposing and efficacy predictions. Meanwhile, non-small molecule therapeutic modalities such as cell therapies, monoclonal antibodies, and RNA interference (RNAi) technology have gained importance due to their ability to target specific disease pathways and/or patient populations. In the field of RNAi, many experiments have been carried out to design and select highly efficient siRNAs. However, the established patterns for efficient siRNAs are sometimes contradictory and unable to consistently determine the most potent siRNA molecules against a target mRNA. Thus, this paper focuses on developing machine learning models based on the cheminformatics representation of the nucleotide composition (i.e. AUTGC) of siRNA to predict their potency and aid the selection of the most efficient siRNAs for further development. The PLS (Partial Least Square) and SVR (Support Vector Regression) machine learning models built in this work outperformed previously published models. These models can help in predicting siRNA potency and aid in selecting the best siRNA molecules for experimental validation and further clinical development. The study has demonstrated the potential of AI/machine learning models to help expedite siRNA-based drug discovery including the discovery of potent siRNAs against SARS-CoV-2.","Thu, 18 Jan 2024 23:00:34 UTC (5,115 KB)"
"147","Subgroup analysis methods for time-to-event outcomes in heterogeneous randomized controlled trials","Valentine Perrin, Nathan Noiry, Nicolas Loiseau, Alex Nowak","Methodology (stat.ME)","Non-significant randomized control trials can hide subgroups of good responders to experimental drugs, thus hindering subsequent development. Identifying such heterogeneous treatment effects is key for precision medicine and many post-hoc analysis methods have been developed for that purpose. While several benchmarks have been carried out to identify the strengths and weaknesses of these methods, notably for binary and continuous endpoints, similar systematic empirical evaluation of subgroup analysis for time-to-event endpoints are lacking. This work aims to fill this gap by evaluating several subgroup analysis algorithms in the context of time-to-event outcomes, by means of three different research questions: Is there heterogeneity? What are the biomarkers responsible for such heterogeneity? Who are the good responders to treatment? In this context, we propose a new synthetic and semi-synthetic data generation process that allows one to explore a wide range of heterogeneity scenarios with precise control on the level of heterogeneity. We provide an open source Python package, available on Github, containing our generation process and our comprehensive benchmark framework. We hope this package will be useful to the research community for future investigations of heterogeneity of treatment effects and subgroup analysis methods benchmarking.","Mon, 22 Jan 2024 11:00:49 UTC (381 KB)[v2] Tue, 23 Jan 2024 08:47:47 UTC (381 KB)"
"148","MolTailor: Tailoring Chemical Molecular Representation to Specific Tasks via Text Prompts","Haoqiang Guo, Sendong Zhao, Haochun Wang, Yanrui Du, Bing Qin","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Deep learning is now widely used in drug discovery, providing significant acceleration and cost reduction. As the most fundamental building block, molecular representation is essential for predicting molecular properties to enable various downstream applications. Most existing methods attempt to incorporate more information to learn better representations. However, not all features are equally important for a specific task. Ignoring this would potentially compromise the training efficiency and predictive accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, which treats language models as an agent and molecular pretraining models as a knowledge base. The agent accentuates task-relevant features in the molecular representation by understanding the natural language description of the task, just as a tailor customizes clothes for clients. Thus, we call this approach MolTailor. Evaluations demonstrate MolTailor's superior performance over baselines, validating the efficacy of enhancing relevance for molecular representation learning. This illustrates the potential of language model guided optimization to better exploit and unleash the capabilities of existing powerful molecular representation methods.

Despite extensive exploration in this field, pre-trained models tailored for peptide-specific needs remain largely unaddressed due to the difficulty in capturing the complex and sometimes unstable structures of peptides. This study introduces a novel multi-view contrastive learning framework PepHarmony for the sequence-based peptide encoding task. PepHarmony innovatively combines both sequence- and structure-level information into a sequence-level encoding module through contrastive learning. We carefully select datasets from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and AlphaFold database to encompass a broad spectrum of peptide sequences and structures. The experimental data highlights PepHarmony's exceptional capability in capturing the intricate relationship between peptide sequences and structures compared with the baseline and fine-tuned models. The robustness of our model is confirmed through extensive ablation studies, which emphasize the crucial roles of contrastive loss and strategic data sorting in enhancing predictive performance. The proposed PepHarmony framework serves as a notable contribution to peptide representations, and offers valuable insights for future applications in peptide drug discovery and peptide engineering.

"150","Uncertainty quantification of receptor ligand binding sites prediction","Nanjie Chen, Dongliang Yu, Dmitri Beglov, Mark Kon, Julio Enrique Castrillon-Candas","Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)","Recent advancements in protein docking site prediction have highlighted the limitations of traditional rigid docking algorithms, like PIPER, which often neglect critical stochastic elements such as solvent-induced fluctuations. These oversights can lead to inaccuracies in identifying viable docking sites due to the complexity of high-dimensional, stochastic energy manifolds with low regularity. To address this issue, our research introduces a novel model where the molecular shapes of ligands and receptors are represented using multi-variate Karhunen-Lo `eve (KL) expansions. This method effectively captures the stochastic nature of energy manifolds, allowing for a more accurate representation of molecular interactions.Developed as a plugin for PIPER, our scientific computing software enhances the platform, delivering robust uncertainty measures for the energy manifolds of ranked binding sites. Our results demonstrate that top-ranked binding sites, characterized by lower uncertainty in the stochastic energy manifold, align closely with actual docking sites. Conversely, sites with higher uncertainty correlate with less optimal docking positions. This distinction not only validates our approach but also sets a new standard in protein docking predictions, offering substantial implications for future molecular interaction research and drug development.","Sat, 20 Jan 2024 19:52:40 UTC (37,666 KB)[v2] Tue, 23 Jan 2024 20:19:25 UTC (37,666 KB)"
