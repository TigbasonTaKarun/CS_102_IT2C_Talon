"7","Bandai Hobby Kit Hg 1/144 Xi Gundam","総合的に完成度高し","てつお","長らく買えるタイミングがありませんでしたが念願叶ってペーネロペーと併せてAmazonで購入、大きさはありますが過去に発売されたクシャトリヤなどの大型機体と同じようなMGとHGの中間のような構成、組立は自分は5時間で完成、裏打ちなどを上手く使っており色分けは中々優秀、ディテールが多く素組みだと物足りなさはありますがスミ入れで大きく引き締まる点が多いです、特に顔のスリットがかなり差が出るので必須。可動はフライトフォームの変形も考慮され一見動かなそうな脇可動から肘可動まで全体的に高品質、特筆したいのが手のパーツで内側のパーツにC字ジョイントを挟み込んで腕部とは棒型のジョイントで接続する方式になっており口径も太いので保持力の高さとHGながらも可動の自由度も高い水準になっています。今作の難点も述べておくとまず全体的にKPSが使用されている点、一般的なガンプラのサイズならまだ許容できますが大型機となるとポリキャップレスだと摩耗などの経年の変化がどうしても気になりブンドド派の場合は緩み対策に加工を考えた方がいいかも、他には開き手の肉抜きはかなり見栄えが悪い、先発のペーネロペーが肉抜き無しだったのでどうしても気になってしまいました。後はファンネルミサイルの再現パーツは無くエフェクトとペーネロペーとセットでの特別キットは定価で買えそうもないしプレバン等でファンネルミサイル＋エフェクトのキットが発売されるのを待つしかない点か…総評としては大型キットということもあり組み上がりの達成感や見えない部分のディテールも凝っており満足出来るキットだと思います、TVで閃ハサが放映された恩恵もあり再販でのAmazon直販にも在庫が出るようになったように感じます。このキットの最大の難点が転売に刈り取られて買う機会が無いという事に感じるので転売が為されることが罪悪とであると考える時代であることを悪質な転売ヤーには心から理解していただきたいのである、我々ガンプラモデラーとしては産業テロリストじみた過剰な吊り上げに対してバンダイが粛々と流通量を出す事により定価でも買える状況が増える事で転売の利に値しない状況が産まれた先に転売ヤーの反省を促す状況へと好転する事でひいてはガンプラ業界全体の先細りも避けられる状況となることを祈るばかりである。","Reviewed in Japan on 11 February 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"30","Bandai Hobby Kit Hg 1/144 Xi Gundam","まあこんなものかと","Damon","組み上げた後の感想です。製作時間は、ゲート処理・墨入れ・シール貼り等をのんびりやりながらで、７時間程度。素組みなら３～４時間もあれば完成するでしょう。全体的に形は良く、ペーネロペーのように特定の部位にパーツが集中するデザインではないため、関節の保持力もまあまあです。やや面倒だったのは、一番パーツの小さい顔でした。顔のパーツは、大体HGのOOシリーズの顔くらいの大きさでした。目のシールは左右別々で、大きいので逆に貼りやすかったです。以下、気になった点です。・大きさの割にシールでの再現ヵ所が多い。脛の脇や後部ミノフスキーユニットの黄色い部分はパーツ分割でもできるのでは、と思いました。・下腕、肩の小さいフィンと紺色のユニットなど、若干、パーツ接合部が表に残る。肩のユニットはともかく、目立つか下腕はもう少し何とかなったのでは。・後部スタビライザーの付け根がパーツ組み換え式。フライト・フォームへの変形は差し替え式なのだから、ＭＳ形態とフライト・フォームとで、きちんと別々にパーツを用意してほしかった。・胸部（インテイク？）など、肉抜きが目立つ箇所がある。手の指はサイズ的に止む無しでしょうが、胸部パーツは、変型時に外側に張り出すため、下から見ると目立ちます。ここは穴埋めパーツを用意してほしかった。後、ランナースイッチでの切り替えを考えていると思わるのは、頭部・胸部（白いパーツ回り）・シールド辺りのパーツのようです。原作のように青い胴体バージョンを出すとか、GFF版とか。あるいは映画の２部、３部で何某かの追加要素（夜間迷彩版、最終決戦仕様とか）を考えているんですかね。楽しみだけど、この値段では、簡単には購入決断できないですけどね。いろいろ書きましたが、個人的には30年以上待った甲斐はあったかなと思いました。","Reviewed in Japan on 6 May 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"53","Bandai Hobby - Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz - Gundam Heavyarms (EW),Bandai MG","Probably the most solid Master Grade kit I've ever built","Gary Hood","Package came exactly as I had expected, fresh off a shelf in an expedient and undamaged manner.  Every piece was in the kit, all was intact, no pieces breaking in transit.  The kit itself is definitely not an introductory kit by any means, and requires plenty of attention due to a number of similar-looking parts that are only visibly different if you look really close.  With that said, this kit is exceptionally sturdy where most of my other Master Grades fail to be, save for one small issue - the peg ends for the ammo belt do need to be superglued to the bendy wire that serves as the spine for the belt; it's exceptionally easy for the wire to slip out, and then you'd need to take it apart just to fit the wire back in.  Beyond that issue, the kit is extremely solid and surprisingly articulate and lithe - which is, rather hilariously, the same thing I said about Heavyarms itself in the show.  Overall, a very worthwhile purchase, especially for the price - the sturdiness alone makes it feel like a kit worth twice what you're paying.","Reviewed in the United States on 30 August 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"67","Bandai Hobby - Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz - Gundam Heavyarms (EW),Bandai MG","Fun kit with a few flaws","Craig Byers","This was my second model kit, as Heavyarms is one of my favorite Gundams. There are a lot of small parts, most fit well (the arms are a little loose, but nothing super aggravating, but I’ve heard glue on the joints helps.) There is space to display all the weapons: gun, knife and shield, so you don’t have to pick which ones to display.The real frustration is with the gun. It doesn’t hold very well, and the chain has a tendency to pop off. I found that super glue on the end pieces of the Gatling chain help, but you have to be prepared to deal with a weak hand grip. Because of that, the gun only really comes up about 45 degrees on its own, and the gund will pop out of the hand easily. It’s a little frustrating, but can be worked around. You could probably apply some glue to help too, but I didn’t.I really recommend taking this kit slow. Make sure you’re orienting things correctly before you snap them down, don’t be afraid to lay out all the pieces in the diagram step before you push them together and move on. Also, there is an unmarked piece of black wire (5 small strands bound together) DO NOT THROW THIS AWAY. It is part of the chain for the Gatling gun, but was unmarked and unpackaged in my box.","Reviewed in the United States on 4 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"68","Bandai Hobby - Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz - Gundam Heavyarms (EW),Bandai MG","Amazing Looking Kit, A Nightmare to Work With...","Craig Byers","I'll start with the good: It looks absolutely immaculate and amazing, even just snap built! Some parts need some color correction, like the gun with it's accessories and the backpack to a black color because it's a slightly darker gray, which is a little off. A little bit of customizing and weathering (it's Heavyarms, he gets dirty!) goes a long way with it and really makes it pop! It's also pretty well balanced and stable, so it can hold a pose really well, even on my handmade custom action base.Now for the bad: Parts of this kit is super brittle and I had parts break on me, namely small, unfixable parts. The chest panel clips feel like they'll break if you try to close them and one did, the extra folding gatling gun handle broke on me, and the backpack arms both broke on me. If you decide to paint, spray paint or topcoat, these problems will become more of an issue. Essentially, I had to buy a whole other kit to replace the broken pieces, especially since I didn't know what could possibly break next. So, if you keep those things in mind and you're very careful, you should be fine, but be prepared for it in case.Overall, love the kit, but it's a beautiful nightmare. Wing kits are known for having their own build issues, so as long as you know what they are and how to deal with them, you'll be fine. Still recommend to all those Gundam Wing lovers out there! 👍","Reviewed in the United States on 18 September 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"69","Bandai Hobby - Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz - Gundam Heavyarms (EW),Bandai MG","Makes you wish there were more Wing kits coming out soon!","james","This kit was the last of ""the five gundams"" that were released a couple years ago following Katoki Hajime's Wing Gundam redesign that was released in 2004. At first I was confused as to how the mecha designs were named and where they came from since there was the T.V. versions, Kai versions, Endless Waltz customs from the movie/ova and now these. I really enjoy Katoki's designs and his decision to redesign the original five gundams to reflect the way they appear in the OVA really made a good excuse to swap colors and milk the kits when/if they decide to release the other 3 custom gundams since we already have deathscythe hell and wing zero custom. In terms of being a built kit, I really enjoyed it. Taking some silver paint and applying it to the rockets really makes them pop when you open up all the missile bays. Since I'm a busy architecture student, I sprayed on topcoat directly onto the frames which I hung from string outside, that took away the plastic shine, allowed the stickers to blend in more unless you're really close to it, and unfortunately reduced the margin of error when panel lining so you have to be careful. This kit requires a little bit of extra work to make it look really nice but it's well worth it when it's done, making it look more like a piece of military machinery than a plastic kit with stickers all over it! Posing is fun and all the joints move a great distance standard for a kit this recent (I'm looking at you Unicorn, your inevitable perfect grade better have 180 degree bends all over the place!) it's just a shame the feet don't bend up to allow some running poses and the beam gatling gun ammo chain can be problematic when you're trying some real dynamic poses. All in all, I highly recommend this kit despite the flaws because putting a little elbow grease can really make it look sharp, you'll have fun putting the model in a variety of poses and as a fan of Katoki's designs, makes me eager for more Wing kits, especially ones from Frozen Teardrop!-Bootz","Reviewed in the United States on 6 April 2013","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"72","Bandai Hobby - Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz - Gundam Heavyarms (EW),Bandai MG","Missiles, Machine Guns, and Gattling! Oh my!","Joey Gunota","I absolutely love this kit.  The design is very appealing, especially if you like something with a lot of missiles.  All the compartments open up as they should to reveal the stored missiles on the shoulders, legs, front and side skirt armor, and the chest opens up to show the machine guns inside.  Typical Master Grade details inside and out with a full inner frame with some decent mechanical detail - especially around the joints.  The hands have swappable fingers allowing you a fist, open hand, gun grip, and beam saber grip for both sides.  The giant gattling gun looks amazing!  the ammunition belt goes together well, although some people have said they had to glue the belt into the gun where it attaches.  I did not have that issue, but it can't hurt anything to do it.  The gattling can be stored on the backpack, the shield can be mounted on the gun or the arm, and Heavy Arms even comes with a combat knife that mounts to the right arm for melee combat.  Additionally, you have the option of building the left arm with a beam saber holder (with beam saber handle, no beam blades included though) instead of the normal arm if you want to pose it fighting your Master Grade Tallgeese kit.  But lets be honest, if you build it that way, you can't mount that awesome gattling gun!","Reviewed in the United States on 3 May 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"73","Bandai Hobby - Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz - Gundam Heavyarms (EW),Bandai MG","exactly what a master grade should feel like","doubletapp","much tighter feel than the wing zero or deathscythe master grades. (i.e wing zero wont hold his cannon in certain positions due to weight. and death scythe doesnt have as firm of a stance when off display) all of the master grades should feel like this one once completed, im surprised how well he holds up the minigun with no slump or loose feeling to it, no wobble to jiggle. if u like gundams and haven't gotten heavy arms yet, you need to get him. I mean aside from being nice and tight, and not like too tight either where its a pain in the butt to manipulate poses or battle stance. I feel like with Heavyarms I simple decide what position I want, and put him in it. no parts fall off, no skirts fall off, not the arms or a leg. And if ur reading this review and have previously built a high grade or up, then you kno what I mean. And while at first glance this gundam isn't my favorite. I would pick wing zero or shenlong/nataku over it. This gundam delivers, more than delivers in my opinion, the tight articulation, the copious amounts of missle pods and weaponry is just stupid. BEAUTIFULLY STUPID.

I am hoping bandai and/or bluefin eventually return to these older kits and update the decals to either one (I would prefer waterslide, because you can use mr mark setter to ""melt"" it to the part).

This is the 4th EW kit I have built, and has all of the really awesome articulation and details that you might expect.The only reason for 4 stars, is that the gun is very flimsy.  The hand will fall off constantly trying to hold it and keep it upright, so I had to unfortunately glue it.  The ammo chain is also very tedious, as you have to cut out each of those small pieces, and then sand down the nubs.  The chain also must be glued so it stays intact, otherwise one mistake could cause all of the parts to fall off.  if none of this bothers you, then get the kit!

The ammo belt is a bit tight in slack so you have to be careful and getting the arm, hand + thumb to stay in the right position is tedious to say the least.Overall this is a great kit, looks wonderful, the details is very impressive.

Master Grades are serious kits with a serious price and you shouldn't hop in blindly.2.) Everyone says this, and that's because its true. There is no blade for the beam saber. Seriously Bandai? What the actual hell?3.) I dont know if this is my kit, or every kit, but the white is a lie. It's much more of a cream color. Im not upset about it (It looks gorgeous) but if you want that white you may have to get a paint brush or else display this guy alone.And the good things. The balance is great, the posing is all good (the Gun limits some of it, but he holds it like a champ)and the build was a lot of fun.Many have said that this is the best of the Wing Ew MG kits, and I can see why.

I purchased this model, hoping the incredible minigun (maxigun??) would win me over. It arrived today and I happily opened the box up to see the sprues.I just can't get past all the missiles on the upper torso. Yeah, I get it. It's sci-fi. Suspend disbelief and all that. But missiles (or mortars, rockets, whatever) on the INSIDE of the doors?? Looking at the pods along the lower leg (which are VERY cool, by the way), there is nowhere near enough depth in the 'lids' to house more whatevertheyare. Ugh. And don't get me started on the nipple-blasters. I have never watched Endless Waltz, but those things at best would be single shot. I hope they aren't supposed to be more miniguns. No way there can be adequate ammo stowage.Now....the minigun? That thing IS freaking awesome. I didn't bust open the sealed sprues, but I did thumb through the instructions. I love how they did the feed chute from the ammo drum to the gun. I am almost tempted to NOT return this just to keep the minigun for some other project.I prefer the 'grunt' gundams....the Buster is my favorite MG thus far. While colorful, it's not garish. It's weaponry borders on feasible. It looks like something you'd find on a battlefield.

Also the stickers were rediculous ( about 100).Pros: all of the cons don't even amount to the joy you get out of building it. The noble suit moves well and after one day of building, 8-10 hours, it was finished. The colors are great and the detail is magnificent.Definitely recommend this for your collection.

The blue details on the chest snap into place removing the need to use decals. The sculpt of the parts is solid, and the amount of detail is very high.Articulation:Limited mobility in the ankles in favor of a more tank-like design. The mobility elsewhere more than makes up for that though. Wide range of poses are available.The special features of this model are what pushes it over the top: Larger chain gun with flexible ammo belt, removable combat knife, and the ability to hide a beam sword in the left arm (beam for sabre not included).Overall this is by far one of the best new models to come out of the new Endless Waltz series of Master Grade 1/100 scale models.","Reviewed in the United States on 4 May 2012","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"115","Bandai Hobby MG Gundam 1/100 Kyrios","I adore this kit!","My Self","I absolutely adore this kit! It is very posable and solid especially after painting. The original orange looks really good actually and looks nothing like the cheese color showed in the Amazon picture. Transformation into jet mode is easy and looks amazing. I just wish the rocket pods could open and had warheads inside. Also effect parts would've been great. That's nit picking though.

"116","Bandai Hobby MG Gundam 1/100 Kyrios","Amazing MG Gundam, Great flexibility","Antonio","The MG 00 series is simply amazing. If you don't have the time or tools for painting as more intense Gundam hobbyists do, this kyrios looks great as an out of the box build. Additionally, these newer kits have sturdier frames and intense range of movement and posing potential, without stands or super glue. I got it in the $45 range, and it's definitely worth it.","Reviewed in the United States on 6 December 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"117","Bandai Hobby MG Gundam 1/100 Kyrios","Amazing kit for any stage of builder highly recommend.","Antonio","What can I say I love this kit I've bought both Seven Sword and Stratos but this kit takes the cake, this kit sits above both of them as in articulation, very posable, and if a little more work is done (i.e adding the details and a bit of shadow lining) this kit pops even more 9/10 for me 😊😁😁","Reviewed in the United States on 18 February 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"152","Bandai Hobby Kit Gundam The Witch From Mercury Full Mechanics 1/100 Gundam Aerial","This has become one of my favorite Gundam models! :D","Spunkers","Hi!I like to start with my rating and overall thoughts. For me, this model is an easy 5 out of 5 stars and has become one of my favorite models.  I feel that this model has a unique design, quite a bit of articulation, a good amount of accessories and neat features, like the beam sabers can be held in the forearms.I wondered how this model would look with two Phased Array Cannons and Beam Diffuse Guns. The price was good, so purchased two of this model to make my vision come true :)–Stickers.I didn’t use any of the stickers that came with the model and there is nothing wrong with them; I just envisioned my model having different colors in those areas. Also, I added the 3 vertical colors to the neck area; there are no stickers included for that neck area and that is fine. I know the colors I chose do not follow the anime.There are stickers for inside the chest, but I forgot to put them there. So, am now deciding how I want to color those.–I snapped some pictures, to help show some various articulation (I didn’t cover all articulation… sorry) and poses.–The leg articulation doesn’t have extreme range, but I feel it is okay. The knee has two bends, which allows for a little better than a 90 degree bend (screenshot).Ankle articulation (screenshot).Built as it is supposed to be, the ankles do not have much forward lean/articulation. By turning the lower leg 180 degrees and then attaching it to the knee, this allowed the foot to have more forward lean.–I think the only thing that might be frustrating for some people is that (for example) the lower leg is attached with a C-clip and can come off easily. And some parts my come off, if used too much. They are easy to put back on, so it wasn’t an issue for me. I feel I’d rather have parts un-attach than break, so this didn’t affect my score.–Pictures with two model kits.The two pictures where I used two of this model kit, I wrote ""Two kits"" in the upper right hand corner.  In those pictures, I made DIY (Do It Yourself) adapters to attach the Phased Array Cannons to the Beam Diffuse Guns.Note: the stand in the photo is not included with the model.–I was extremely pleased with this model. With the 2nd model’s parts, I want to use to try kitbashing the parts :)Hope this review and the pictures were helpful. Take care! :)","Reviewed in the United States on 12 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

These are orders of magnitude greater in terms of every single aspect you can imagine better than those. From ease of building, to articulation, to gimmicks, to color separation. The fact that you can remove these from their runners without the need for tools is amazing (although you might want to get something to at least smooth down the teeny nub left over). Now that these are so cheap, I am fighting the urge to buy at least seven more and use them for practice.","Reviewed in the United States on 8 May 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"224","Bandai Hobby Kit Entry Grade 1/144 Rx-78-2 Gundam (3L)","High-quality, beginner-friendly kit.","J. Doyle","Cleverly engineered and offering loads of technology and value in a low-cost package, this is a quick and easy build that can hold its own with more expensive kits. Almost every color detail is replicated through ingenious design & molding, and the snap-fit construction requires no tools and is simple and straightforward. On top of that, you get some really fantastic posability for such a low-priced kit, which greatly adds to its overall appeal.Unfortunately it does not come with blades for the beam sabers, which is an unusual omission, but given the extremely low price it's understandable (and beam parts from any other 1/144 kit can be used here, if you have them.)All in all, this is a kit that is both perfect for first-timers who have never touched a Gundam model before, and for long-timers who want a good, cheap base for kit bashing and experimentation.

Il livello di dettaglio e realismo è molto buono, e il modello rispecchia bene le proporzioni e le caratteristiche del Gundam originale. Il montaggio è facile e divertente, seguendo le istruzioni chiare e illustrate fornite da Bandai.

"246","Bandai Hobby Kit Entry Grade 1/144 Rx-78-2 Gundam (3L)","Good model, but there are some issues...","Emmanuel Lopez Aguirre","I got the Strike Gundam. It was fun to put to together, but I had some issues getting it to pose right. The torso keeps popping off from the waist, and the legs really, really don't want to move at either the hips or the feet. Honestly, it'd be nice if the torso of the Strike Gundam connected to the waist like the RX-78-2 Gundam does. In my opinion, the RX-78-2 has a superior construction in contrast. Maybe changing the tolerances for the ankle and hip pieces would help with posing, and changing the construction of the Strike Gundam's torso would keep it from popping out so often. However, it was fun to build, and the parts aren't too difficult to remove from the runners. The plastic is durable; I almost broke one of the gray accents for the knees, but I was able to bend it back into shape.","Reviewed in the United States on 22 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Gli stampini sono stampini ad acqua, quindi bisogna bagnarli per riuscire a toglierli dalla loro posizione e per poterli applicare, poi bisogna passare del cotone tamponato leggermente per asciugarli, il problema è che una volta completamente asciutti iniziano a staccarsi e a venire via uno ad uno, come se fossero delle foglie secche. Non riesco a capire il perché di questa cosa, sarebbe più facile con degli normali stampini come hanno moltissimi modellini simili.

waltz」版のそれよりも全身に施されたディテールの追加や、シールドの装備により可能になった「ネオバード形態」への変形機構も盛り込まれた「ハイエンドモデル」となっています。各可動部関節機構も練り込まれ、現存するウイングガンダム系モデルの中で最も優秀な可動範囲を誇る。あえて不満点を挙げるとすると「主翼」ですね。先の「HiRM」「GFFMC」が新たな可動ギミックを搭載しての登場に対し、旧MGモデルのそれと余り代わり映えしない事ですかね。「GFFMC」版の様にボディ各部のパネル開閉ギミックが無いのは残念ですが、むしろその事が良好なスタイリングを造り上げてる要因になってるのかとも。11/30追記「パーツチェック」額縁に入れて飾る事が決定している箱を開封、そしてパーツチェック。旧MG版とは比較にならないパーツ数に目眩でクラクラしますが、16年(？)分の技術向上は伊達ではない。特に「MGプロトゼロ」では使い回し(？)だったヒイロのフィギュアが、今回は完全新規になった造形が凄い(笑)デカールは水貼りタイプは良いのだが、ランナーパーツと一緒ごた、しかも裸で入っているので、傷まないウチに購入したら直ぐに袋から出して保護してやろう。ビームサーベルのクリアパーツはウイング系キット使い回しのタイプで新鮮味ない。ここはもっとアクティブな形状のを新規で作ってくれても良いのよバンダイさん？シールド形状が「MGプロトゼロ」と同型だが、裏側のディテールはカッコいい専用デザインに。しかしプロトゼロにあった「伸縮機能」はオミットされてるのはちょっと不満。TV版ゼロとの数少ない共通点を何故無くしたの？バスターライフルが折り畳み式になり、これまでとはパーツ構成が大きく変わってて、組み立てるのが非常に楽しそう。特筆点は前腕とのジョイント式になり、安定してライフルを構える事が可能になった点だろうか。本体の方はこれまでのウイング系キットとはかなり構成が変わってる様(フレームは基本KPS製だがABSの部分もある等)なので、とりあえず後は実際に組み立てて見ないとだな。…続く12/12追記「頭部作ってみた」「今さら？」ってな声が聞こえる気がしますが、気にせずのんびり行きますね～ツインアイ、頭頂部前後、アンテナ基部が無色クリアパーツになっておりまして、私はいつもツインアイの隈取り部分は艶消しブラックで塗装、ツインアイは付属のシールをメタリックグリーン部分のみ切り出して貼ります。クリアパーツを活かしてクリアカラーを塗るより、結局この方がツインアイの主張が強くなりますしね。他のセンサーはクリアパーツを活かして、ガイアカラーの蛍光グリーンクリアタイプを塗装し組み上げました。因みにアニメ本編だと頭頂部のセンサーは紫かピンクだったような気がしますのでその様にするのも良いですね。組み上げてから気付いたのは、後部センサーから入った光りで、前面センサーが若干ながらも発光するって事。私は艶消しブラックに塗装してしまったので確認出来ませんが、こりゃひょっとしたら、ツインアイにも光りが通るかもしれませんね。頭部は合わせ目が極力出ない様、パーツ分割りは巧みです。クリアパーツのセンサー部分にパーティングラインがありますが、小さいのでそんなには目立ちません。後、ツインアイとマスクの間(鼻？RX-78なら赤い部分)は別パーツになっていましたね。完成した頭部は非常にかっこよく、開閉ギミック付き耳センサーが横に広がり過ぎの画像もありましたが、旧MGモデルと同様のバランスに、頬のダクトが開口されてる等、ディテールもアップデートされてます。はい？あぁ、マスクの「∧」は開いてませんよ、安心してください(笑)　次は胸部～胴体かな？続く…12/14更新「胸部を作ってみた」おそらくこのキットで最も複雑なパーツ構成であるユニットである「胸部～腹部ユニット」の組み立てですので、説明書とにらめっこして慎重に組み立てます。２軸可動式でしっかり開閉する「肩部マシンキャノン」の砲口パーツは小さく、無くしてしまいそうなので、前もって砲身パーツと接着します。接着剤を乾燥させてる間に他のパーツを組んで行きます。「胸部～腹部ユニット」可動部分が多く、組み立てながら可動部分のチェックをしながらの組み立てになりますが少々はめにくい部分もあります。K1,14とK1,15のパーツが説明書だと前面から差し込む様、指示されてますが中々奥まで入らない場合は上からはめて見てください。K1,3も少しはめにくいですが、位置を確認して奥までしっかり差し込みましょう。首の赤いパーツA34は差し込み部分が無くても支障が無い為、私はニッパーで切り飛ばしました。この方が組み立て後も分解しやすくなります。同じ理由でマシンキャノンの差し込み部分(丸)も少しだけ短くしました。全体的に外装パーツは組み立て順が決まっており、間違えると組めなくなってしまうので、パチ組み派は注意してください。完成した「胸部～腹部ユニット」をじっくり眺めて見ましょう。パーツの合わせ目はディテールとして処理されており、旧MGモデルと比較すると凹凸処理されたハイディテール。勿論プロポーションには破綻無し。可動部分がアップデートされ、特にボールジョイント、軸可動部がそれぞれ２箇所ずつある首周りは４重関節で非常に動かしやすいです。胸～肩周りの４軸可動、腰の２軸可動により「ファイナルシューティング」時を再現する為に可動箇所が多いですが、各関節の可動範囲はさほどでも無いってのは意外。特に重量のある「ウイングユニット」「ツインバスターライフル」「専用シールド」を支える理由からか、背中を反らす方向にはほぼ動きません。腰部分は貧弱になる「ボールジョイント」は一切使用されてないのはともかく、横方向への可動部分がないのは少々残念。ここからは余談です「サーチアイ」が少々、小さい気がするのとパーツ構成上、前面から「レンズの縁まわり」が見えるのか嫌だったので「Hアイズ」で使用出来る限界サイズ(8mm)のものに差し換えました。その際レンズの裏に「水貼りデカール」でそれらしい文字入りマークを貼り付け、ベースをいつもなら「ラピーテープ」にする処を「DAISO蓄光シール丸(7mm)」にしてみました。ラピーなら直に光りを反射しないと「暗い(黒い)」んですが、直接光りを当てなくとも「蓄光」は常に「ボヤ～」って感じで発光してる(様に見える？)直に光りを当てると更に明度が上がり、ブラックライトにも「蛍光」同様に反応。かなり面白い効果がありました！12/31 追記「腕部の組み立て」肩部分から組み立てます。ウイングガンダムゼロEWは、どの部分を切り取っても非常にスタイリッシュなデザインで、私的に最も好きな部分が「ショルダーアーマー」今回も凝ったパーツ構成でインテーク状インナーフレーム共々、合わせ目が出ない様に設計されている為かパーツが多い。この後に組む上腕～前腕が簡単に思える程でした。注意点はパーツB1,25とB1,24の間に挟むパーツ I (アイ)26の嵌め込み部分が固いので、破損には注意。センサーブロックのクリアパーツも嵌め込んでしまうと外せなくなるので、仮組派はピンバイスで穴を開けておくと良いでしょう。可動部分の渋みも申し分ない感じ。新ギミックとして、ロール可動可能になった前腕、そのセンサーブロックもスムーズにスライド。そして次回からは下半身に着手します。1 / 1 「スタンド & 腰部の組み立て」「ウイングガンダムゼロ」等、「背負いモノが巨大」なキットは「ディスプレイスタンド」が必須。バンダイさんも解ってらっしゃる。ちゃんと「ディスプレイベース」が付属してます。「ウイングユニット」に着手する前にスタンドを組み立てておくと安心でしょうか？付属のスタンドは旧MGの「簡易版」ではなく「アクションベース」としてもまだ市販されてない特別仕様？！組むまではてっきり「アクションベース４(５)」だと思ってました。パッと見た目はアクションベース１に近いのだけど金属製ボルト、ナットの廃止、可動部分も改良した新型アクションベースで、各部の剛性も向上しており素晴らしい！組み立て時は挟み込みパーツが多いので注意が必要だが、組み立て時に要所を接着して組むと更に剛性が向上する。是非とも市販化して欲しいですね。因みにMS形態時は専用ジョイントを使用するが、根本の角度が90度ずつしか変えられない。そこでスタンドの余剰パーツ１番と、専用ジョイントパーツH１番の接着面の凸凹を金ヤスリで平らに(これ大事)し、平行(二の字形ね)に重ねて田宮セメントで接着。更に隙間にアロンアルファを流し込みガッチリと接着。更に更に１ミリ真鍮線を４本通して過剰にまで補強、脱落すると大惨事ですからね。これで角度45度ずつと、微妙な調整が可能になります。これまた凝った可動部の「腰部」は説明書通りに組み立ててもなんら支障は無かったですね。フロントアーマーは上部へ180度は可動するので、脚部の可動範囲に期待が持てる。アーマーもモールド入りで裏側も完璧。注意点はスタンド接続の際、スラスターが余剰パーツになるので紛失しやすい。そこで私はよくスタンド裏等にマスキングテープで貼り付けたりしてます。1 / 2 「脚部を作る。そして本体の完成」足首部分から組み立てますが、脚部分でも最も多いパーツで構成されてまして、爪先の可動が追加されてたりしますが、実にしっとりと組み上がります。完成した脚部は全て共通パーツで左右の区別は全くありませんので、股関節に接続するブロックを180度回転させれば左右入れ替えも可能。個人的に気になった部分では、これまでの「ウイングガンダムEW」のキットにはあった、足首フレームのくるぶし部分側面の白い装甲がなくなってる。なんでだろう、結構好きな部分だったのに。それとアンクルアーマー後部に開閉する可動部分があるのだが、これが何に使うのか謎。そういえばプロトゼロのはここに下部に伸びる装甲があるが何故か無可動だったことを思い出した。完成した脚部を上半身に接続し、やっと本体完成！ウイングユニットがあると弄り難いので、今のうちにポージングに馴れておきましょう！特に説明書の「20-1」で両腕基部(両胸)スライド部分は胸部ユニットが完成した時に慣らしておいたのだがまだ固く、組み立て時にメンタム(シリコングリス)を塗っときゃ良かったと後悔した程。(結局ばらして塗りました)足首の可動範囲は二重関節(BJと軸可動)の割に左右は並み(う～ん)だが、前後にもほとんど動かず(オイ)少々窮屈に感じます。爪先は良い感じで動くものの、裏側にモールドが無いので足裏爪先のディテールが間延びして中途半端に思えるね。エッチングパーツでも貼ると良いかもしれませんね。大腿部にはお馴染み、前面装甲が膝の屈伸で連動スライドするギミックがありますが、膝前面ブロックとふくらはぎの装甲は手動で可動なのは拍子抜けかなあ。膝を最大屈伸させても違和感無いのは凄いんだけど。片膝立ちポーズも難なく決まる！って言いたいが、やはり腰に左右関節が無いので、上手くやらないと上半身が少し左右に傾く。しかし弄ってると「ギミックが無い箇所が無い」事に改めて気付く。凄いよね。じっくり眺めてると(白)の成形色が部分的に違う事に気付く(説明書カラー１項にも説明あり)ブルーが２色あるのは明確だが、初め白は全く判らなかった。個人的にはこの位の方が好感が持てる。ブルーもウイングゼロEWでは本来濃いブルーの方が正解(アニメでは終始、宇宙や夜のシーンのみだったからと言うのもあるが)明るい方のブルーはもう少し明度を下げて欲しかったかな。そうそう成形色と言えば、ウイングゼロEWのマニピュレーターの色はホワイトなのか、グレーなのかとしばしば討論になるが、私の認識では「設定ではホワイトだがOVA本編ではグレー」プラモデルに絞るとホワイトの成形色は、1/60PG(手のひらはグレー)、1/100MG(グレーも付属)、1/100MG Ver.Ka　ガンダム系で指が白いのはゼロEWのみ(？)と特別感があって私はこっちの方が好きだったりするが、どちらも正解と言えよう。1 /3 「武装」本日は武装であります。まずは超簡単な「ビームサーベル」たった２パーツで完成！ではあんまりなので、一工夫。ビームエフェクトパーツのパーティングライン及び全体を400～600番の紙ヤスリで削り、仕上げはメラニンスポンジで艶消しにしました。この方が発光してるように見えませんか？「ツインバスターライフル」ツインなので２つ組み立てますが、右用、左用で違いがあるので、パーツの切り出し～組み立ては片側分ずつ行いました。挟み込み部分が多いので注意です。折り畳み式、前腕接続パーツなど新ギミックを盛り込みつつも合わせ目が無い仕上がりに脱帽。特に折り畳みギミックは、デザイン変更無しでよくぞここまでと言える出来ばえ。センサー部にクリアパーツを使用してれば最高だったのだが。「シールド」MGウイングガンダムプロトゼロEWのシールドと同デザインだが、歴とした専用設計で格納式ジョイント、ヘッドユニットカバーの可動等、見処満載と思いきや、プロトゼロにはあった先端部伸縮機能のオミット、両脇のバルカン砲(？)の省略、前腕への取り付け部分の貧弱さ等、少々詰めの甘さが見えなくも。特に取り付け部分は「上から引っ掛けてある」だけ(？)なので脱落することもしばしば。ライフル、サーベルの装備は専用の指パーツで固定出来るのは良いのだが、ライフル用のは各指が何故こんな歪な角度になっているのでしょうか？サーベル用のは指がキレイに並んでいるが、こちらのものではライフルのグリップの差し込み穴には合わない仕様。共通でも良かったのではと疑問に思う。この指の形状は「MGウイングガンダムTV版」から気になっていましたが、今回のは白いので余計に目立つ。平手は指の間付け根に水掻きが付いてるのは強度的な問題もあり仕方ないが、ホビー事業部のロボット物プラモデルキットはハンドパーツにいつも不満を感じる。マジンガー等INFINITY HGシリーズもその１つ。それこそスーパーミニプラのハンドパーツの方がはるかに表情豊かな平手とか付いてて好感が持てると思う。 スーパーミニプラはパーツ精度はともかく、ギミック的な技術はホビー事業部を追い越しそうな勢い。あちらは様々なロボットやメカを新アイデアで商品化してるが、ホビー事業部は基本ガンダムばかりだからなあ。おっと、話しが逸れてしまったが、いよいよ完成が見えてきました。1 / 4 「ウイングユニット」いよいよ最終パート「ウイングユニット」の組み立てになります。しばしば説明書の順番は無視しますが、今回も基部である「バックパック」から組み立てました。パチ組み派はなんの問題もなく、パチパチっと組み立てれば終了します。が「仮組派」はそうもいかず、分解出来るように嵌め込み部分の調整をしながらの組み立てになるのだが、このバックパック、巨大な翼を四枚も支える為、分解出来る様に穴を拡げたりすると脱落してしまう恐れがあります。かと言って無調整だと分解不可能になる事は明白。そこで私はA18とG29を極小ビスによりネジ止めにしました。A18の受け穴をドリルで拡げ(ドリルは逆回転で使うくらいで良い)A18の天面でG29と重なる部分にピンバイスにて、ネジ穴 1.5mm、A18は2mm開けてネジ頭部分が埋まる様に加工。これで後翼ごと脱落する事も無いだろうか。そして後翼の組み立て。基部はビームサーベル収納も兼ねてますが、合わせ目が出ない様にデザインされてます。が、肝心のウイングの方がダメダメです！センターにガッツリ合わせ目が出来てしまう仕様にガッカリ。開閉ギミックはまあまあ悪く無いが、硬い。開く時、破損するのではないか？ってくらい力がいります。前翼の組み立ては、小羽の根元のBJをネジ切らない様、擦り合わせをしながら組み立てれば問題はないでしょうか？この前翼と可動アームの接続部分は今回、新規パーツ追加により自由度が増したのだが、このパーツのデザイン、取って付けた様で正直あまり良いとは思えません。同じ理由からライフル懸架用フックも機能性はともかく、ガンダムの中でも異質で生物的デザインが賛否両論の翼なのに、ここにまたメカニカルなデザインのフックが生えてるって一体どうなんだ？ここはフック格納状態では目立たなくなる等の工夫が欲しかった。翼自体の可動に関しては、旧MGのそれとあまり変わらないが、裏側のディテールの再現は進化してますよね。これらウイングユニットを本体にセットし、全ての組み立ては終了。1 / 4 「遊んでみた その１」本体自体の可動はスムーズ(組み立て時に調整出来るのはプラモデルならでは)なのでポージングはしやすいですが、やはりライフルとシールドの脱落が鬱陶しいですね。ライフルは前腕とジョイントすれば安定するのでまぁ良いが、シールドは少し上にズレただけで脱落するからなあ。やはりここは改良の余地ありですね。手の甲もポロポロ脱落するので、接着した方がストレスにならないと思う。因みにライフルには「GFFMC」用のメッサーツバークの装着も可能。旧MG用のメッサーツバークは所持してないが「GFFMC」用メッサーツバークは旧MGのライフルにも取り付けられるので、おそらく装備可能と思われる。誰もやらないと思うが、シールドも旧MGの赤いフィンパーツを外せば装備可能。少々ぐらつくけど。「ツインバスターライフル」でいわゆる「ファイナルシューティング」のポージングは肩関節を引き出せば、胸部のスライド機構は無しでも難なく可能です。これは旧MGでも可能だったからなあ、不要な機能だったかも。比較用に今回「旧MG」「GFFMC」を引っ張り出して来たが、後者は前翼の可動が凄い！が、非常に弄り辛い！MGくらいのがちょうど良いのかもです。旧MGは現在の視点でも非常に格好良く、16年間ベストセラー(？)になるのも頷ける完成度に改めて敬意を感じますね。1 / 5 「遊んでみたその２ 変形」「ウイングガンダム系」は飛行形態に変形可能なMSですが、「Zガンダム系」の様に複雑ではありません。かの「勇者ライディーン」を元祖とするいわゆる「寝そべり変形」で、ここまで組み上げて来た方たちなら最早、説明書など不要、完成見本画像を見ればもう変形させられる事でしょう。見本通りに変形させるのも良いが、各ユニットを自分なりのカッコいい角度やタイミングを探してみるのも良いでしょう。例えば、TV版ではバード形態時に下半身が180度回転する為、脚部分が天地逆になりますがEW版は腰が45度しか回せないので不可能。しかし大腿部のみを180度回転させる事でTV版のイメージに近づかせることも可能等々、自分だけのオリジナルネオバード形態(EW)を産み出そう！1 / 7 「総評」大胆なアレンジが賛否両論だった「HiRM」受注生産完成品高級トイ「GFFMC」に続く待望の本命「MG Ver.Ka」最後発なだけあり洗練されたクセのないデザイン処理、各部の可動ギミックによる広い可動範囲に変形等々見処満載、現時点における「最良」のウイングガンダムゼロEWと言えよう。最軽量で実は最も扱いやすいのも◎「HiRM」「GFFMC」「MG Ver.Ka」は現在プレ値ですが「MG Ver.Ka」はプラモデル、大量生産が可能なので供給安定すれば買い安くなる(はず)　個人的には改良したい部分は、ライフルやシールドの保持力、腰部の横方向への可動部分の追加くらいで、非常に満足度の高いキットでした。1 / 11 「ストレスを極力減少させるポイント」本日は弄ってるとストレスになる部分の改良点をいくつか1「後翼開閉ギミックの改良」開閉時に少々固くて破損しそうになる、パーツ J6 とD2 をがっちり接着してしまいましょう。これで剛性が上がり、開閉させやすくなります。さらにパーツD4,D3 の J6がスライドする部分にロック用のポッチがあるが、ここにグリスを塗っておくと尚良いだろうか。余談だが、これまでのモデルでは後翼のアーム側に有った可動部分が、今回のではバックパック側に移動しており、ネオバード形態(大気圏外モード)での全高(上下の高さ)を抑える事で、航空機としてのリアリティーを演出してる反面、MS形態時では可動範囲が狭くなってしまった気が。腕に覚えがあるなら可動部分を追加するのも良いだろう。2「ツインバスターライフルのグリップ可動範囲が広過ぎる」ストッパーが効くまでグリップを展開して装備させると、どうしても銃口側が下がってしまいます。展開側での可動範囲が広過ぎですので、ストッパー位置をプラ材等で調整しましょう。脱着装備しやすくなり、心なしかライフルのポロリもしにくくなった気が。3「ツインバスターライフルの折り畳み」バスターライフルの基部とバレルを接続するジョイントは「C形」だが、迂闊に折り畳むとここが破損しそうになる。コツは、C形ジョイントがシャフト部分から浮かない様に可動させるとうまく行く。ここもC形から○形に改造出来れば良いだろうか。4「ツインバスターライフルのサブセンサー(？)」合体時に下方に展開する部分ですが、展開時にバラけやすいので接着した方が良いと思います。現時点で気が付いたのはこんなところですね。","Reviewed

"269","Bandai Hobby 1/100 Scale MG Wing Gundam Zero Ew Ver.Ka Action Figure","It's a masterpiece","Amazon カスタマー","Edit: 10 month ownership review: One of the left wings broke right off. I managed to pick at it and make it still pose-able but it's very limited. It was amazing at first but it's just a bit too flimsy. Whenever I want to play around with it and put it in a pose it becomes a chore and parts always fall off. Still looks incredible but gonna lower my rating because of how delicate it is.This thing is an absolute masterpiece. It's enjoyable to build and the level of detail and intricacies are amazing. It's easy too so I'd say it's beginner friendly as well since it's only my second ever gunpla and my first master grade. Lots of articulation and comes fully equipped with the twin buster rifles, 2 beam sabers and the shield. You can even store the buster rifles in the wings for tons of variation in poses.The only issue I had was that a part on the gauntlets that attaches to the shield was a bit looser than I liked and the stand is a bit flimsy.Also it comes with waterslide decals, so if you're planning to apply those I HIGHLY suggest getting some sort of adhesive/glue. Water itself doesn't work well and Zero is shedding decals like a dog sheds fur. Since they're so small it's hard to find them again once they do fall off. This was easily the most frustrating part of the build, legit spent almost 2 days just applying the decals. I'm a noob when it comes to gunpla so I thought water would be sufficient, but I'll probably get some adhesive next time. Also would suggest applying the decals after you finish each part individually so it's easier instead of doing it once the whole thing is built.Other than that though it still looks amazing without the decals and overall it's just magnificent. Love seeing Wing Gundam Zero in the iconic twin buster rifle pose with the wings flared sitting on my desk.","Reviewed in Canada on 11 June 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"270","Bandai Hobby 1/100 Scale MG Wing Gundam Zero Ew Ver.Ka Action Figure","Good but not perfect","Rak","It’s an almost completely solid kit. The use of ABS plastic definitely helped out with some of the parts. Though not all parts that should have been molded in ABS were. That small issue is what keeps this kit from being perfect for me. I have broken many of the pieces that peg into the backpack to support the main wings. But a friend and I will modify replacement parts I got for it by drilling a small hole into the peg and slotting in a small brass rod. If that works I’ll update my review for this kit to reflect that, and add a few pictures of it as well if I can do that. Also side note the reason that you’ll see different colored hands on mine vs everyone else’s is the fact that I had to get another MG Proto Zero to finish up that build as I broke one of the hinges for the wings, and took the fingers and palms from the extra MG Proto Zero.","Reviewed in the United States on 26 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I'm not really a fan of Gundam Wing, but this is a beautiful kit and I'm glad to own it.A quick note: the top wings have a gimmick which opens the feathers on opposite sides when you pull them out. They need to be ALIGNED CORRECTLY BEFORE YOU SANDWICH THE TOP AND BOTTOM WING PARTS TOGETHER. On my first wing I had them a couple notches off so they didn't close properly and I had a real pain getting the wing back apart again.So it's not the EASIEST kit in the world, but it's not terribly difficult, either.

If you don't...Master grades aren't a good beginner's spot, especially ver ka models. There's a few finicky parts. I really had to fight with the arms to get them to stay on properly, and the shield is still kinda a pain.It looks utterly gorgeous though, and thankfully includes a base. Those wings are HEAVY.  Comes with a ton of waterslides, although I probably won't use them. I like my kits without a bunch of lines and lettering all over. The weapons look great especially the twin buster rifles, and the wings are fantastic. Great range of motion and color separation.

The box had the original strapping on it to ensure nothing was missing in the box, however the box it came in was crushed on all sides which upset him, as a Gundam model maker and collector he saves all of his boxes for display. He almost returned it because of this reason. The Amazon box that the Gundam box was shipped in was in perfect condition so the damage must have happened at the wearhouse.

The Ver.ka solved that issue, even though there was a more expensive Frozen Teardrop version that did so before.But Ver.ka, in addition to the Neo Bird Mode and twin buster rifle storage, is a lot more detailed compared to the original Zero EW MG. In fact, I dare say a full on improvement. The only thing is, I can't seem to stand Ver.ka on its own compared to the older one. Had a lot of fun, and a fitting way for me to ring in the New Year with it.","Reviewed in the United States on 3 January 2021","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Imprescindibile tuttavia un minimo di conoscenza base sui Gunpla e gli strumenti necessari (tronchesi da modellismo e bisturi per rifiniture), nonché TANTA pazienza. La scala 1/144 implica pezzi molto piccoli e delicati, nonché microscopici adesivi che richiedono obbligatoriamente delle pinzette.Incantevole, ma non per principianti del modellismo. Pressoché obbligatorio l'acquisto di una basetta da posa (Action Base), in quanto le ali sbilanciano all'indietro il modellino.","Reviewed in Italy on 16 August 2019","4.7 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Obviously you can take this a step further with painting, detailing, etc. It's extremely poseable, to the extent that posing it can be sort of tricky (looking at you, quadruple-jointed knees). The inner frame is great and on top of that you have panels sliding past each other giving the feeling of a real complex machine.I was concerned about the bulky wings not staying in place, but it seems they've hit the sweet spot between easily movable and staying in place. For accessories you get 4 sets of hands (fist, open, trigger, and poseable), the two big guns that can combine together, and a pair of beam sabers. You also get the teeny-tiny pilot figurine and an adapter to mount it on a peg base.Overall I think this was a great kit to put together and it looks awesome on display. Definitely worth buying.","Reviewed in the United States on 6 February 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Parts B2-24/25 are the main foot joint and its connections to parts A-11 and C-21 are molded too large.

"402","BANDAI HOBBY HGBD:R Gundam 1/144 EARTHREE Gundam","Minor complaints, good kit overall","Ryan","My first completed kit and a very fun one to build. A couple complaints, though: the hands are built from two pieces that form around whatever weapon it's holding, which means you can either take them apart, put a weapon in, and close them back up, or hold it together and push the weapon in. This isn't a huge gripe, but the hand pieces are also rather loosely held together, meaning that they'll often split apart when the model is being moved. I recommend gluing the hand pieces to each other. My other issue is the reason this kit took a long time to build (about 6 hours, twice as long as a similar kit) because it forced you to build the armor into a support unit FIRST, then apply it to the model.

A bunch of parts that when not in use is stored on the core flier, a part thats compatible with all of the core gundam first type’s gear.The planets system is what this suit’s gimmick of armor is called. This is why it’s called the “earth three” as each version is named after one of the planets in our solar system.

Für ein Geschenk kann es daher für Viele schon knackiger und ein Zusammenlegen erforderlich werden.Für das Geld bekommt man jedoch knappe 650 Teile, was schon stattlich ist und viele weitere Bauoptionen erschließen kann.Lobenswert ist die Verwendung von nur sehr wenigen Spezialteilen, was die Vielfältigkeit im Hinblick der Nutzbarkeit der Steine erhöht. Die goldene Helmabdeckung sieht natürlich toll aus und schafft neue Improvisationsmöglichkeiten mit den Steinen.Warum Lego jedoch auf vier Finger pro Hand gesetzt hat, erschließt sich leider überhaupt nicht für mich. Aus meiner Sicht hätte man hier auf dieses Detail schon wert legen können, es korrekt auszuführen.Unabhängig davon sind Lego-typisch viele Elemente am Astronauten, aber auch am Hund (Laika?) beweglich, der Astronaut ist via Ständer aufstellbar.Alles in allem Legotypisch ein qualitativ hochwertiges, toll gestaltetes Creator-Set, was sicherlich viele Fans des Weltraumes anlocken wird.","Reviewed in Germany on 12 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA

"511","LEGO® Creator Space Astronaut 31152 Kids' Viper Jet Model Set, Space-Themed Toy for Boys and Girls Aged 9 Years Old and Over","Simply stunning","Dave65quality","If you remember the old Lego or childhood, multicoloured bricks and only square things to build- you are in for a shock.  This 3-in-1 Space set, mainly Astronaut is really a construction toy for youngsters, the instruction booklets ( 3 of them) sets down minutely which brick to use at each step, how to align and fit it and how many times to do it- it's a really complex operation and great for pre-teens in not just creating a toy, but also exploring the concept of complex instructions and fine motor skills.At the end you get a nice sized Astronaut figure, but more importantly a sense of accomplishment at having built it yourself.You know the materials and assembly is going to be great quality- it's Lego, it arrives in a large box, 5 separate bags containing the pieces well packed and very tidy. The design is very clever and a little focus is needed to successfully make it, but you child can make it with you, and once they have made the main item, they can, if they want take it apart and make Fido the space pooch!  After that, they may want to use their imagination for other concepts- you can't go wrong with it, the only surprise is the price- it's more than I remember a box of bricks were, but there again it builds a better astronaut.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2024","4.8 out of 5 stars",NA

And being shiny silver would be better, or maybe even possibility to be able to open/close the top a bit lower down.Second part are astronauts boots, looks boots have been replaced by trainers.Despite all that, it's lovely to have more space Lego being released, and I have no doubt that my daughter will be extremely happy when she sees this gift!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA

It makes use of ball-and-socket connectors and lots of bricks that change the orientation of the studs.It’s not an overly-complicated build, but would be a challenge to younger children. Taking turns, it probably took us 45 minutes, though on your own you might be quicker.The astronaut is posable, with lots of articulation points, including shoulders, elbows, wrists, fingers, hips, knees and ankles. It comes with a stand so that you can ‘float’ the astronaut, as if in space. The mounting point for the stand is loose, so could be prone to falling if knocked.The finished model has plenty of detail and looks decent.

Me gustan mucho los Legos desde que era pequeño, me parece que fomenta la creatividad, desarrolla las habilidades motrices y hace que estés concentrado, ya de mayor me gusta para coleccionar alguna saga en concreto (como los de marvel por ejemplo)Este set de Lego es de la serie Creator, se trata de un set que permite crear un astronauta, además queda super bien. Viene un pedestal para ponerlo en casa. Tiene la característica que con las mismas fichas a parte de poder crear un astronauta también puedes montar una nave o un perro astronauta y todo ello a través de 647 piezasEstá destinado para niños de más de 9 años y  es muy completo.El precio es de unos 50 euros, que me parece que está genial.Conclusión:Me ha gustado mucho, muchos detalles, se monta fácil y garantiza horas de diversión.Nota:Le pongo un 9  sobre 10.Mis opiniones las puntúo con los siguientes criterios :1 ★: Producto de mala calidad o que no hace lo que promete. No recomiendo su compra.2 ★★: Producto que es de mala calidad aunque hace lo que promete, no recomiendo su compra..3 ★★★: Cumple lo que promete, aunque hay opciones mejores.4 ★★★★: Buen producto aunque tiene alguna pega, pero es recomendable su compra..5 ★★★★★: Excelente producto, buena calidad y hace lo que promete.

"545","LEGO® Creator Space Astronaut 31152 Kids' Viper Jet Model Set, Space-Themed Toy for Boys and Girls Aged 9 Years Old and Over","Un set davvero imperdibile per tutti gli amanti dell'esplorazione spaziale","Oscar","Modello ""importante"" appartenente alla serie Lego Creator. La caratteristica principale di questa linea è quella di proporre in una sola scatola ben tre modelli costruttivi separati (non realizzabili simultaneamente). Naturalmente uno è quello principale, che usa tutti i mattoncini, mentre i restanti due sono delle realizzazioni alternative. Io mi sono concentrato sul soggetto principale e più realistico: ovvero la riproduzione di una tuta per astronauti per attività extra veicolari (EVA) in contesti orbitali. Per intenderci NON è una tuta spaziale del tipo utilizzato per l'esplorazione del suolo lunare. Come è legittimo pretendere, il soggetto è ricchissimo di fedeli dettagli, a cominciare dal backpack che contiene non solo la scorta di ossigeno ma anche fari, console di comando, strumentazioni e i mini jet per muoversi ed direzionarsi nel vuoto. Le articolazioni offrono tutte una buona mobilità e a questo proposito è possibile posizionare a proprio piacimento persino le quattro dita - assente il mignolo - dei guanti. Al fine di prediligere l'ampiezza dei movimenti, in alcune articolazioni come ad esempio gomiti e caviglie, si perde un po' la sensazione estetica di gonfiore tipica di una tuta spaziale, in favore di un aspetto quasi meccanico. È tuttavia un dettaglio secondario che non rovina il colpo d'occhio complessivo della figura. Il supporto offre un assetto molto stabile a tutto il soggetto, garantendogli al contempo una posa davvero molto realistica, tanto che l'astronauta, se visto frontalmente, dà effettivamente la sensazione che stia galleggiando nel vuoto. Ho apprezzato anche il fatto che i sacchetti principali siano realizzati in materiale cartaceo, che sostituisce almeno in parte la classica busta di plastica trasparente. Aprendo un sacchetto alla volta, ve ne sono cinque in tutto, stimo un tempo medio di completamento del soggetto variabile dalle due alle quattro ore. Consigliatissimo a tutti gli appassionati di esplorazione spaziale, grandi o piccoli che siano!","Reviewed in Italy on 1 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA

"547","LEGO® Creator Space Astronaut 31152 Kids' Viper Jet Model Set, Space-Themed Toy for Boys and Girls Aged 9 Years Old and Over","Schönes Set für Weltraumfans","Dan","Das Set ist wirklich schön gemacht und wenn man Astronauten und das Weltall mag dann kommt man auf seine kosten.Der Karton ist schön bedruckt und es sind alle 3 Modelle abgebildet die man damit bauen kann -  natürlich nicht alle auf einmal sondern mit einem Set eins von den 3.Wenn man den Karton aufmacht sieht man auch gleich 3 Anleitungen so das man nicht nur eine hat und die anderen auf Lego.com aufrufen muss, das finde ich super. Was auch toll ist, ist das Lego auf die Plastiktüten verzichtet, die einzelnen Bauabschnitte sind in Papiertüten verpackt.Der Aufbau gestaltet sich als nicht zu schwierig, da finde ich 9+ etwas optimistisch, ein 7jähriger hätte damit wahrscheinlich keine Probleme, da muss man einfach individuell schauen und es nur so als grobe Richtlinie sehen.Es baut sich auch schön flüssig und die einzelnen Schritte sind einfach und übersichtlich gestaltet, es ist also nichts zum KnobelnSchön finde ich auch das die Figur so beweglich ist und man auch den Rucksack abnehmen kann und es auch zum Spielen geeignet ist und nicht nu als Staubfänger fürs Regal.Ein paar Kritikpunkte habe ich allerdings auch, zum einen Hat der Astronaut kein Gesicht. Ja es passt eine Minifigur in den Helm, aber dann hätte Lego auch gerne eine dazu legen können, selbst wenn es auch nur eine 0815 Figur im Astronautenanzug gewesen wäre. Zudem hat der Astronaut nur 4 Finger, als wäre es eine Simpsonsfigur.Insgesamt ist es ein schönes Set mit ein paar kleinen Makeln weswegen ich 4 Sterne vergebe.","Reviewed in Germany on 30 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA

Mi hijo, que tiene 9 años y le fascina todo lo relacionado con el espacio y la exploración espacial, quedó encantado con el regalo que le hice: el LEGO Creator 3 en 1 Astronauta Espacial. Este set es increíble porque tiene 647 piezas que se pueden usar para armar y desarmar tres modelos espaciales diferentes: un astronauta, un perro espacial y una nave de ataque espacial. Así, los niños pueden elegir el modelo que más les guste y crear sus propias aventuras galácticas.Lo más impresionante de este set son las figuras espaciales que se pueden mover. El astronauta y el perro espacial tienen piernas, pies, brazos, dedos y patas que se pueden ajustar para ponerlos en diferentes posiciones divertidas, lo que hace que los juegos sean más interactivos y personalizados.Cuando terminan de jugar, los niños pueden colocar las tres maquetas en unas bases para construir que vienen incluidas, y así mostrar sus creaciones en su habitación. Esto no solo les da un toque decorativo, sino que también les enseña a los niños a valorar y cuidar sus obras de arte.Además, el set LEGO Creator 3 en 1 Astronauta Espacial no solo ofrece diversión física, sino que también estimula la creatividad de los niños a través de la aplicación LEGO Builder. La aplicación les permite guardar sets, ver su avance y explorar versiones en 3D de sus modelos mientras los arman.En conclusión, este regalo espacial es perfecto para los niños que sueñan con el espacio, ya que les ofrece una experiencia de construcción y juego divertida y educativa.","Reviewed in Spain on 29 January 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA

It has been released to go with the new Dune film due out shortly.The model is well made and comes with the usual Lego quality of brick moulding and instructions, with the relevant parts coming in separate bags, referenced in the thorough and large instruction book. After nearly 1400 pieces, the model is finished and is huge, especially when fully opened up. You also get eight mini figures to go with main model, all in Dune style.My only issue with this model is that some of the parts were not easy to fit together, frequently popping apart when other parts were being fitted. This something I have noticed with other larger models from Lego in the past and is something that makes these large builds both entertaining and frustrating at the same time.Value wise, this is not a cheap model kit, but it is large and is priced similarly to other Lego themed models.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 February 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"605","LEGO® Icons Dune Atreides Royal Ornithopter 10327 Collectible Building Set for Adults,for Lovers of Sci-Fi Films","A technical marvel, captures all the important features of the Ornithopter.","Dave B.","As a fan of Dune and sci fi in general I was absolutely delighted to get my hands on this set, a large and accurate mini-figure scale model of the House Atreides ornithopter! The most important thing to note is that this is very much a Lego Technic set at its core, although the final appearance is more akin to system type sets, there is an awful lot going on inside the main body to realise the various moving functions, especially the eight oscillating wings.Due to this, it is a challenging build and most definitely a set best suited to the adult audience or at the very least someone experienced in Technic builds. That said, I found the build instructions very clear and appreciated the little annotations at certain points which help explain the purpose behind some of the clever techniques and mechanics used to recreate the moving functions. The tail section is very strong and houses a mechanism that makes the wings move. Each wing is slightly offset from each other to recreate the dragonfly like movements. There is also a neat function that folds the wings back along the body when the vehicle has landed. Lastly, twistable elements on the side are used to deploy the landing gear and lower a rear boarding ramp. Whilst access to the main body is negated due to the Technic functionality needed, the build does feature a large cockpit area with seating for two mini-figures. Various trans clear elements, including two large Star Wars windshields are utilised to great effect to recreate the large field of vision the crew enjoyed whilst piloting the ornithopter. There are no stickers utilised in the set, with only three printed elements needed for the build, two of which are awesome Atreides military logos which look fantastic.A generous selection of eight mini-figures is included, featuring most of the main characters in appearances that are accurate to the recent Denis Villeneuve films. This makes the model ripe for inclusion in Arrakis based MOCs and me hopeful of more sets based on the Dune franchise, especially with the new film just days away.Overall, I really enjoyed the technical build on this set, whilst appreciating the display aesthetic which is more in line with the appearance of my favoured system based builds. I’d recommend this set to anyone who is a fan of Dune and / or those who like a challenging technical Lego build.Lastly, many thanks to the Amazon vine program and of course the Lego group themselves for giving me the chance to try this set out, I really enjoyed this one!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 February 2024","4.0 out of 5 stars",NA

Inutile dire che è stato affascinante montarlo, seguendo le istruzioni sempre impeccabili dei prodotti LEGO, vi dico che non è difficile ma ci vuole concentrazione perché se sbagliate un piccolo dettaglio rischiate di dover ricominciare da capo.Bellissimo e stra-consigliatissimo!Ps. a me è arrivato nella brown box del day one che per i collezionisti ha ancora più valore.Niks","Reviewed in Italy on 15 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

So bei mir geschehen. Für meinen Neffen, der Geburtstag hatte und trotz seines noch recht jungen Alters bereits komplexe LEGO-Bausätze gemeinsam zusammen bauen kann, entschied ich mich für einen Produkttest des „Atreides Royal Ornithopter“ aus Denis Villeneuves Sci-Fi-Epos „Dune“.Die Lieferung war nach zwei Tagen bei mir (Prime), blickdicht und sicher verpackt geliefert worden. Der Karton selbst ist relativ groß (45x28x12 in cm) und besteht aus insgesamt 1369 Bauteilen. Das Produkt ist laut Bezeichnung erst für Personen ab 18 Jahren und älter geeignet. Ich halte das nach dem Aufbau für irreführend. Ja, das Modell ist komplex im Aufbau und man benötigt schon mindestens 1-2 Stunden an Zeit. In meiner Kindheit habe ich Ähnliches aber auch bereits mit 14 Jahren zusammengebaut – ohne Hilfe. Wenn ein Erwachsener dem Kind im Alter ab 9 Jahren beim Aufbau mithilft, ist das völlig ausreichend und es haben sogar beide Spaß daran. 😊Nach dem Öffnen des Kartons findet man 10 Nummerierte Tüten vor, wobei die Flügel des Ornithopters in einer separaten Verpackung im Karton aufbewahrt sind. Die Aufbauanleitung erstreckt sich über 220 Seiten und stellt zu Beginn auch die Figuren und das Szenario einleitend vor. Nach der Anleitung lässt sich der Ornithopter mit etwas Geduld und Aufmerksamkeit ohne Probleme zusammenbauen. Ein schönes Extra ist hierbei die Möglichkeit den Ornithopter bzw. seine Bestandteile ein- und auszuklappen. So lassen sich das „Fahrwerk“ (die Füße und Beine) ein- und ausklappen und die Flügel können durch Drücken an einem „Gestell“ geschwungen werden, was sehr gut aussieht und funktioniert. Hier hat sich LEGO nah am Film orientiert. Auch ein Modus für den Sturzflug/Freien Fall ist möglich, so dass sich auf der Stelle die Flügel einklappen lassen. Das Cockpit mit den „Glasscheiben“ lässt sich bequem öffnen und die mitgelieferten Figuren, von denen es insgesamt acht Stück gibt, können dort hineingesetzt werden. Die Figuren sind liebevoll gestaltet und besitzen auch ein Gesicht auf Vorder- und Rückseite, so dass die Gesichter unterschiedliche Ausdrucksweisen und Designs zeigen.Ganz ohne Kritik kommt das Set allerdings nicht aus. Am Ornithopter werden teilweise rote und blaue Pins verbaut, manchmal auch schwarze Pins. Die blauen und roten Pins passen so gar nicht in das Gesamtbild des Flugzeugs. Wer die Möglichkeit hat, tauscht diese aus, da sie doch schon auffallen. Wen das nicht stört, kann über diesen kleinen Kritikpunkt gerne hinwegsehen.Fazit:Wir hatten beim Zusammenbau des Flugzeugs viel Spaß. In ein paar Jahren, wenn mein Neffe dann das nötige Alter erreicht hat, können dann auch die epischen Filme angesehen werden. Bis dahin wird er viel Spaß haben und ich freue mich darüber, ihm ein schönes Geschenk ermöglicht zu haben. Für alle Erwachsenen, die im Herzen jung geblieben und Fan des Films sind, kann ich dieses LEGO-Produkt ohnehin nur empfehlen. Hier wurde wirklich nicht gekleckert, sondern geklotzt.","Reviewed in Germany on 10 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA

Le petit dernier a adoré mais il a évidemment fallu l'aider car avec 1 369 pièces et ce niveau de détails l'on est bien entendu davantage sur un modèle adulte qu'un modèle enfant. C'est sans doute, d'ailleurs, plus un modèle de décoration que de jeu mais l'on peut tout de même s'en servir comme tel. Nous l'avons finalement exposé en vitrine dans la salle de jeux chez nous et cela donne un super effet !Rien de particulier à redire sur la qualité et le montage sinon. On retrouve la bonne facture habituelle de la marque. Les pièces s'assemblent et se défont facilement, elles sont bien usinées et ne sont pas fragiles (y compris pour les plus fines). Les instructions sont claires, bien détaillées et donc assez simples à suivre, surtout si l'on a l'habitude. Il faut tout de même prévoir du temps à y consacrer mais l'on s'en doute vu le nombre de pièces !Au total, nous avons été pleinement satisfaits à la maison mais il faut dire que nous étions déjà amateurs de Lego® de longue date donc c'était un peu du terrain conquis haha !

"642","LEGO® Icons Dune Atreides Royal Ornithopter 10327 Collectible Building Set for Adults,for Lovers of Sci-Fi Films","Nahezu Perfekt","Taylor","Ein wirklich gelungenes Set, gerade für Dune-Fans! Die Optik ist super, die Funktionen genial und es ist ein Haufen an coolen Minifiguren dabei. Der Aufbau der inneren Technikkonstruktion war interessant und spaßig und das fertige Set ist sowohl zum Hinstellen als auch zum Spielen sehr gut geeignet.Das Fahrwerk und die Laderampe werden im Landemodus ausgefahren und die Flügel lassen sich einfach zurückklappen. Highlight ist aber auf jeden Fall das Schlagen der Flügel im Flugmodus. Wenn man einmal den richtigen Takt, zum Drücken der Funktion, gefunden hat, sieht das einfach nur eindrucksvoll aus und macht eine Menge Spaß.Die Minifiguren sind detailliert gestaltet und alle wichtigen Charaktere sind enthalten. Besonders die Umsetzung von Baron Harkonnen ist sehr cool geworden. Lediglich Paul Atreides sieht etwas so aus, als wäre er im Trainingsanzug unterwegs.Der einzige, wirkliche Wermutstropfen sind wohl die bunten Technik-Pins, die am Ende leider etwas herausstechen. Hier hätte man das Set perfekt machen können, hätte man diese doch entsprechend eingefärbt. Wen die Pins hier nerven, der sollte schauen, ob er die Teile in einer passenden Farbe bekommt  oder in der eigenen Sammlung findet. So katastrophal finde ich sie persönlich nicht, kann aber verstehen, wenn man sich daran doch sehr stört.Alles in allem bin ich mit dem Set aber sehr zufrieden. Die positiven Punkte überwiegen hier doch gewaltig.Ein kleiner Tipp noch für den Aufbau:Die Funktion der schlagenden Flügel funktioniert erst am Ende so richtig, wenn auch die Flügelelemente auch befestigt wurden! Ich habe zwischendurch wieder alles auseinandergenommen, weil es mir irgendwie komisch vorkam und ich mit einem Fehler meinerseits gerechnet hatte.","Reviewed in Germany on 23 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA

Da überrascht es kaum, dass sie schnell den Weg ins Lego-Universum gefunden haben. Und der Ornithopter ist eabsolut perfektes Modell dafür, denn es spielt die Stärken der Klemmbausten perfekt aus: Rumpf, Flügel, Funktionen und Figuren bilden ein wirklich bewundernswertes Ensemble. Aufbauen durfte ich nur wenig, mein zehnjähriger Sohn hat das in Rekordzeit erledigt. Ich will ihn aber nicht nur ins Regal stellen, wir spielen ihn einfach ins Star Wars-Universum ein. Passt perfekt. Allein der Preis von aktuell 10ct je Teil verrät, dass hier irgendwie Lizenzgebühren und auch das Erwachsenen-Lego-Plus am Start sind. Ein (kleiner) Wermutstropfen.","Reviewed in Germany on 22 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA

"647","LEGO® Icons Dune Atreides Royal Ornithopter 10327 Collectible Building Set for Adults,for Lovers of Sci-Fi Films","Ein schönes und anspruchsvolles Lego Set","Nicolas","Mein jüngster Sohn (Lego Champions) und ich (Lego Star Wars) mögen die Sets von Lego sehr und haben schon einige Lego Sets aufgebaut und erfreuen uns immer wieder daran. Mein Tochter hatte bisher immer wieder mal den Wunsch geäußert, dass Sie auch gerne mal ein etwas anspruchsvolleres Lego-Set aufbauen möchte und da kam das Lego-Set LEGO 10327 Icons Dune Atreides Royal Ornithopter im Rahmen des Amazon Vine Programms sehr gut gelegen.Auch wenn es auf der Verpackung angegeben ist, schadet es nicht zu erwähnen, dass dieses Set für Personen ab 18+ geeignet ist, wobei meiner Meinung nach auch Jugendliche ab 14+ das Set problemlos aufbauen könnten. Es besteht aus 1369 Teilen und garantiert meiner Meinung nach schon einige Stunden an Bauspaß. Meine Tochter hat sich Zeit gelassen und den Aufbau genossen. Das Set selbst ist echt schön und ich finde dieses auch gelungen. Die enthaltene Minifiguren Paul Atreides, Lady Jessica, Gurney Halleck, Chani, Leto Atreides, Liet Kynes, Duncan Idaho und Baron Harkonnen in seinem langen Mantel gefallen sowohl meiner Tochter als auch mir ziemlich gut. Das Set steht nun bei Ihr im Regal und ich denke, dass es nicht Ihr letztes Lego Set sein wird.Auch wenn das Set mit einem Preis von 132,99€ (Stand 15.02.2024) nicht gerade günstig ist, eignet sich dieses dennoch sehr gut als Geschenkidee für Personen die Dune Fans sind, oder einfach nur ein anspruchsvolles und schönes Lego Set bauen möchten.","Reviewed in Germany on 15 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA

Der Zusammenbau hat viel Spaß gemacht und es war eine Freude zu sehen wie hier langsam eine Burg entsteht. Wenn man bedenkt wie klein das Modell am Ende ist, ist das Vorbild dank vieler kleiner Details sehr gut getroffen. Es gibt auch einige interessante Bautechniken, dank der guten Anleitung sind diese kein Problem und der Bau war für mich sehr kurzweilig.Bei den Dachsteinen in Dark Tan gibt es Farbabweichungen. Ich finde das darf gerade bei gleichen Steinen nicht vorkommen. Am Ende fällt es aber nicht auf, da ich die Steine entsprechend vorsortiert hatte.Bei den Barren in Dark Bluish Gray sind die Angusspunkte leider sehr gut zu erkennen, ansonsten ist die Steinequalität aber durchwegs gut.Da mich am Ende aber das Gesamtpaket überzeugt hat und ich einige Stunden beim Bauen entspannen und abschalten konnte gibt es von mir trotzdem 5 Sterne.Versand von Amazon war wie immer super.","Reviewed in Germany on 24 November 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"727","LEGO Icons Vespa 125 10298 Scooter, Vintage Italian Iconic Model Building Kit, Display Collection Décor Set for Adults","Schönes Stand-Modell mit noch etwas Luft nach oben.","Kurt","Die Umsetzung des klassischen „fließenden“ Formen der Vespa ist den Designern von Lego erstaunlich gut gelungen. Auch die Farbauswahl und die Details (etwa die Motornachbildung, die Weißwandreifen und die Nachbildung der filigranen Vorderradaufhängung) überzeugen.Die Anleitung ist selbsterklärend, auch auf die Entwicklungsstufen der unterschiedlichen Rollermodelle seit den fünfziger Jahren wird eingegangen. Unsere Tochter hatte mit dem Bau keine Probleme, in drei Stunden war das Modell fertig.Nun zur Qualität der Umsetzung des Modells, das von Lego mit rund 100€ UVP aufgerufen wird: Die sog. „Farbseuche“ hält sich in Grenzen, die bunten Steine des inneren Aufbaus sind nach der Endmontage so gut wie nicht mehr zu erkennen. Bei einem relativ hochpreisigen Modell kann man jedoch erwarten, dass es zu keinen Farbabweichungen der Blautöne kommt. Das ist jedoch nicht der Fall: Bei dem Sattel und der Verkleidung des Reserverades fallen diese Abweichungen nicht ins Gewicht, weil „Leder“ und „Stoff“ durchaus unterschiedlich „abgenutzt“ sind. Aber deutliche Abweichungen gibt es dann bei der Karosserie, verstärkt durch die Abweichung des Farbtons, wenn man die relativ großen hellblauen Aufkleber, etwa für die Lüftungsschlitze der Motorabdeckung verwendet. Hier hätte man sich bei dem Preis mehr Prints gewünscht. Nur der Tankdeckel ist ein Print. Unnötig gespart hat man auch beim „Scheinwerferglas“, hier stört die große Noppe im Zentrum im Vergleich mit dem Original. Auch die Scheibenumrandung und die Zierleisten in Grau hätten bei dem Preis durchaus eine Umsetzung in Chromfarben verdient. Unnötig wird auch bei der Innenverkleidung der Front gespart, mit einigen Fliesen im Cent-Bereich hätten man die Noppen verdecken können, wie etwa bei den seitlichen Zierleisten (siehe Photo).Fazit: insgesamt 3,5 Punkte für das Standmodell. Gut geeignet als Geschenk nicht nur für Vespa-Liebhaber. Dank Amazon ist der Preis selbst kurz nach der Neuerscheinung schon bei eher angemessenen 70€ im Sommer aufgerufen worden. Lego hat jedoch im Herbst allgemein die Preise für das Sortiment angehoben und vor Weihnachten gibt es traditionell einen Preisanstieg für Klemmbaustein-Geschenke.","Reviewed in Germany on 17 November 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"823","LEGO® Technic 2022 Ford GT 42154 Building Kit for Adults","Lego Technic vs. Modellautos","Filip Bertilsson","Nachdem ich nun meinen Ford GT zu 2/3 fertig gebaut und mir ein paar Reviews hier und auf YouTube angeschaut habe, komme ich nicht drumherum, ebenfalls meine persönliche Meinung zum vorliegenden Modell kundzutun.Im Internet wird das Set oftmals für seine fehlende Nähe zum Originalfahrzeug kritisiert und dass man es nur am Ford-Emblem erkennen könne. Dazu muss ich sagen, ja, das stimmt und vor allen Dingen hat Lego die Scheinwerfer optisch komplett verbockt. ABER: Meines Erachtens hatte Lego Technic (!) noch nie den Anspruch, wirkliche 1:1 Modelle der Originale zu liefern. Es gab immer Abweichungen zum Vorbild, mal mehr, mal weniger dramatisch. Und erst mit den richtig absurd teuren Sets wie das des Bugatti Chiron ist dieses Problem deutlich geringfügiger. Meines Erachtens ist die Idee aber hinter Lego Technic mehr diese, gerade das unmögliche halbwegs möglich zu machen, eben mit Technic-Elementen die Karosserie so realitätsnah wie eben möglich zu treffen, kombiniert mit interessanten Technikfunktionen. Und das tut dieses Modell meines Erachtens voll und ganz, auch wenn es über keine schaltbare Gearbox verfügt, das Lenkrad sich nicht mitdreht und die Scheinwerfer nur mit viel Fantasie dem Original entsprechen.Dafür gibt es auf der Haben-Seite einen für Lego Technic Verhältnisse toll designten Sportwagen in einer tollen Farbe mit schönen Funktionen wie Einzelradaufhängung, Flügeltüren, ausfahrbaren Heckspoiler, einem sichtbarenu Differential sowie einem durchsichtigen 6-Zylinder Motorblock.Gegen das Modell spricht dafür die übliche ""Farbseuche"" im Unterboden, in diesem Fall wirklich nervige Aufkleber statt Prints, die fehlende Gearbox und das sich mitdrehende Lenkrad oder aber ganz dem Vorbild entsprechend eine Absenkfunktion des (leider viel zu hohen) Fahrwerks. Auch hat mich das braune Element bei der ""Hand of God""-Steuerung furchtbar aufgeregt - wieso kann man dort nicht alles in Schwarz halten?! Die Leute, die das Set tatsächlich nachbauen, wissen was ich meine. Hier musste erstmal der schwarze Edding gezückt werden. Auch waren die Bauschritte durch die Kontrastarmut der Anleitung nicht immer super zu erkennen. Aber hey, dafür kostet dieses Set mit knapp 1.500 Teilen auch weitaus weniger, als die meisten anderen Lego Technic Fahrzeugsets auf dem Markt, die dann eben über diese Features verfügen.Ich bin daher der Meinung, für das, was man hier bezahlt, bekommt man ein wirklich tolles, interessantes und bis auf wenige Kleinigkeiten wie nervige Sticker etc. wunderschönes Set. Und ganz ehrlich, wem so sehr die optische Nähe zum Originalfahrzeug fehlt, der sollte sich vielleicht einfach überlegen, statt einem Lego Technic Set nicht doch besser in ein klassisches Modellauto zu investieren...","Reviewed in Sweden on 28 December 2023","1.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"853","LEGO® Minecraft® The Mushroom House 21179 Building Kit and Toy House Playset","Super!!","Mattis Werner","Das Lego Minecraft Bienenhaus ist ein fantastisches Set, das sowohl Minecraft- als auch Lego-Fans begeistern wird. Dieses Set verdient ohne Zweifel fünf Sterne!Der Zusammenbau war ein Vergnügen. Die Anleitung war übersichtlich und leicht verständlich, und die Qualität der Lego-Steine war wie immer erstklassig. Es war eine Freude zu beobachten, wie das Bienenhaus nach und nach Form annahm, und es war erfüllend, die vielen Details zu entdecken, die dieses Set zu bieten hat.Was dieses Set wirklich besonders macht, ist die liebevolle Nachbildung des Minecraft-Universums. Das Bienenhaus sieht aus, als wäre es direkt aus dem Spiel in die reale Welt übertragen worden. Die Bienen sind süße und realistische Ergänzungen, und die Möglichkeit, sie in das Set einzufügen und herauszunehmen, um ihr Verhalten nachzuspielen, ist eine tolle Idee.Die im Set enthaltenen Minifiguren, Alex und einen Bienenstock, sind großartige Ergänzungen, die das Spielen noch spannender machen. Man kann die Szenen aus dem Spiel nachstellen und eigene Abenteuer im Minecraft-Bienenhaus erleben.Insgesamt ist das Lego Minecraft Bienenhaus ein beeindruckendes Set. Es ist nicht nur unterhaltsam zu bauen, sondern auch ein großartiges Sammlerstück für alle Lego- und Minecraft-Enthusiasten. Die Liebe zum Detail und die hohe Qualität der Steine machen es zu einem ausgezeichneten Wert. Ich kann dieses Set nur wärmstens empfehlen und freue mich auf weitere Lego-Minecraft-Abenteuer!","Reviewed in Germany on 24 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Admittedly, I am slightly biased due to it being rather cute, but my children do agree with me so there is that.Very clear building instructions, as is always the case thankfully, and a nice set to sit and help build. Priced well (unsure of the current price but it was good when purchased) and the box was in perfect condition when arrived and no dreaded bashes.High quality bricks which is definitely worth the additional cost as these last brilliantly. Would recommend this set to anyone even if not a Minecraft fan or buying for one.

Die Bewertung spiegelt meine persönliche Meinung/Erfahrung zu dem Produkt wider und wurde seitens Amazon oder dem Hersteller nicht beeinflusst.Bewertet wird hier das Set 21253 ""LEGO Minecraft Das Tierheim"" (206 Teile).5 Kleine Tiere aus der Minecraft Welt, ein Tierpfleger und ein bisschen Ambiente, fertig ist das Lego Set. Ist zugegebenermaßen nicht sonderlich viel, aber für Minecraft Fans trotzdem ein riesen Spaß. Vor allem, wenn man nicht nur ein Set der Minecraft Serie hat. 😉Hier gibt es eigentlich gar nicht viel zu sagen. Jeder kennt Lego, fast jeder hat mit Lego gespielt und auch die heutigen Kids spielen trotz Smartphone und Konsole zwischendurch gern mit Lego.Die Qualität der Klemmbausteine ist Lego-typisch Oberklasse, die Teile passen alle nahtlos zusammen, es sind alle nötigen (und ein paar mehr) Teile dabei und die Anleitungen sind auch für Kinder verständlich, sodass sie damit auch ""allein"" Erfolgserlebnisse haben.Natürlich darf der Hinweis nicht fehlen, dass Kinder dabei, je nach Alter, durchweg beaufsichtigt werden müssen. So ein kleiner Legostein ist schnell in Mund, Nase, sonst wo verschwunden und dann wird's kniffelig. All die nötigen Warnhinweise sind selbstverständlich auf der Packung aufgedruckt.Der Preis ist, wie bei Lego üblich, im oberen Segment angesiedelt. Ob sie es wert sind, kann drüber gestritten werden.Da möchte man nochmal Kind sein. Wenigstens darf ich zuschauen. 😁Pro:➕ Lego-Qualität➕ alle notwendigen Steine vorhanden➕ Anleitung leicht verständlichContra:➖ hoher PreisFazit:✅ Kaufempfehlung!","Reviewed in Germany on 6 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Diciamo che rispecchia il trend “mini” che gira per ora. Veramente belli i personaggi e tutte le costruzioni, fatte molto allo stile Minecraft, che ho apprezzato tanto.La scatola è si grande ma soprattutto per la presenza di molti pezzi grandi, ma anche piccoli per le decorazioni. Come difficoltà di costruzione, diciamo che non ce n’è quasi stata, e non ci ho messo neanche tanto a montarlo nel complesso. Sono si tanti pezzi ma comunque abbastanza grandi e voluminosi, per cui si costruisce in poco tempo.Veramente carini tutti gli animali e anche molto bello come continuando la costruzione la casa e il tutto prendono sempre più forma. Lo stupore dei lego non smentisce mai, e probabilmente è proprio questa la cosa più bella del costruirli.Da appassionato di minecraft sicuramente rivedere gli animali o l’ascia è veramente bello, ma come costruzione in se a prescindere dal gioco risulta carina anche per decorazione.","Reviewed in Italy on 7 February 2024","4.8 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"917","LEGO® Star Wars: Ahsoka Ghost & Phantom II 75357 Building Toy Set","Excellent set","Techniker","My son got this for Christmas and due to recent TV programs all the Rebels ships have had a bit of a refresh including this one.You get the two ships though the Ghost is far and away the star of the show, with the Phantom docking on top. Lots of detail and detachable bits, hatches and a nice interior on the Ghost. The mechanism to hold the Phantom is also good.My son is aged 10 and built this in after hours on his own - so the 10+ rating is spot on, with younger builders likely to also be able to manage most of it other than the tricker bits around the ‘wings’.  Usual shooters in the front though with a clever slider that moves the gun and fires the dart.A good collection of characters especially with Hera and her son, Chopper and also two other slight more random ones. Very good leg details as is now seems to be becoming more standard on recent Lego sets.A really good Star Wars set - highly recommended,especially if you have the other ones like the T-6","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 December 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"952","LEGO® Star Wars™ 332nd Ahsoka’s Clone Trooper™ Battle Pack 75359 Building Toy Set, Featuring Clone Captain Vaughn and a Stud-Shooting Speeder","Ein seit drei Jahren überfälliges Battlepack.","M. G.","Lego scheint inzwischen besessen von der 501. Legion zu sein. Aber ich beschwere mich nicht.Zum Fahrzeug:Für ein Battlepack ist dieser Sumpfgleiter mal eine halbwegs gut verwendbare Beigabe im Vergleich zu manch anderen Battlepacks, bei denen manche Modelle noch nicht einmal konkrete Vorbilder aus dem Star Wars-Universum hatten. Der Sumpfgleiter hier erfüllt die wesentlichen Funktionen des Vorbilds: zwei Sitzplätze und zwei Kanonen. Trotzdem wirkt Legos Interpretation zumindest auf mich etwas zu klein mit Blick auf die Vorlage, wobei die richtige Größe bei kleineren Fahrzeugen wie Speederbikes zu finden, zugegebenermaßen allgemein etwas schwierig ist, da Minifiguren selbst keine menschlichen Proportionen haben. Zumindest würden sich in einem etwas größeren Maßstab wahrscheinlich einige Details, wie die Kanonen oder der Schlauchrand der hinteren Plattform, etwas eleganter darstellen, die hier ja doch sehr vereinfacht dargestellt bzw. angedeutet sind. Etwas schade ist noch der Umstand, dass sich das Triebwerk nicht mehr wie bei der 2014er Version bewegen lässt. Was dieser vierbeinige Studshooter darstellen soll, kann ich nicht sagen; so wirkt er auf mich sehr einfallslos.Zu den Figuren:Die normalen Klonsoldaten der 332ten finde ich gut gelungen; sicher hätten zu dem beigelegten Sumpfgleiter Klone des 327. Sternenkorps oder des 41. Elitekorps in Kashyyykmontur besser gepasst, aber was solls. Lego hält auch weiterhin daran fest, nicht mehr zwischen animierten Artstyles und den Live Action-Versionen bei den Klonen zu unterscheiden, was zu mehr Konsistenz in den Klonsammlungen seit 2020 führt und ich deshalb begrüße. Die größte Schwäche ist aber immer noch der Umstand, dass Lego es nicht mehr schafft, die Bedruckung auf dem Helm bis an den Helmkamm nahezu lückenlos heranzudrucken, was aber vor 2020 z. B. bei Commander Gree noch möglich war.Captain Vaughn empfinde ich leider als nicht ganz so gut gelungen: Da bei ihm die gleiche Bedruckung des Helms wie bei den anderen Klonen hier verwendet wird, fehlen bei ihm die dunkelroten Markierungen unter seinem Visier und seinem Mund, die Sonnenblende wäre in dunkelrot akkurater gewesen (die gab es mal 2011 in einem Battlepack in dunkelrot), die Rechtecke seines Rangabzeichens auf seiner Brust müssten so wie bei Commander Cody gefärbt sein (wobei man vielleicht hier noch argumentieren könnte, dass Lego hier gewissermaßen eigenständig die Vorlage aus der Serie korrigiert hat, da das 3D-Modell für Vaughn auf dem von Cody basiert und bei der ""Neubemalung"" offenbar das Rangabzeichen vergessen wurde, da ""Captain"" Vaughn nicht den gleichen Dienstgrad wie ""Commander"" Cody hat), die vorderen beiden Taschen an seinem Koppel müssten zusammen mit der Bauchplatte seiner Rüstung grau sein und diese beiden Streifen auf seinem Helm neben dem Helmkamm wie bei Cody sind auch nicht angedeutet (wobei diese in der Serie durch die Bemalung des Helms nahezu gar nicht auffallen und somit für mich noch verschmerzbar wären). Wie schon bei der Minifigur für Commander Cody ist auch für Vaugh das Jetpack leider nur ein Druck. Schade.Da diese Fehler die Vaughn-Minifigur mit entfernter Sonnenblende unter vielen normalen regulären Klonen der 332ten nahezu unauffällig machen, könnte man argumentieren, dass erstere Minifigur so designt wurde, damit man sie als regulären Klon der 332ten verwenden kann, wenn man eine größere Sammlung von Klonen der 332ten durch mehrere Battlepacks aufbauen möchte, was ich auch nachvollziehen kann. Trotzdem hätte ich mir eine akkuratere Ausführung für Vaughn gewünscht. Er hätte ja nicht unbedingt in einem Battlepack kommen müssen, stattdessen hätte man z. B. dem aktuellen Kanonenboot die klassische Bemalung geben können und als Minifiguren sämtliche aus der Serie namentlich bekannte Mitglieder der 501. Legion beilegen können, inkl. Vaughn. So gäbe es ein krönendes Highlight in Legos aktueller Serie von Sets, die der 501. Legion gewidmet sind und die Community inkl. mir müsste sich nicht über den völlig misslungenen Commander Fox ärgern. Fives, Jesse und co. sind sowieso cooler. Schade, dass es letztere so aber doch erst einmal nicht von Lego geben wird. Ich schweife ab.Schön ist, dass die normalen Blaster für Battlepacks wieder endgültig Normalität geworden sind. Etwas schade ist noch, dass das lange Blastergewehr nicht wie bei anderen Battlepacks mit dem schwarzen Aufsatz kommt, was mMn. v. a. bei Klonen besser aussieht, da das Gewehr so mehr an das standardmäßige DC-15A-Blastergewehr der Klone herankommt.Ansonsten wäre vielleicht noch ein normaler Klon der 501. Legion schön gewesen, da es aktuell nicht mehr ganz so einfach ist, sich diese für akzeptable Preise zu beschaffen. Aber immerhin kann man sich mithilfe des aktuellen 501st Clone Troopers Battlepacks noch ein paar reguläre zusammenstellen, indem man ein paar Helme tauscht.An der Teilequalität gibt es in diesem Set nichts auszusetzen.Die UVP von 21 € ist wirklich dreist. Ja, Inflation und bla, aber dafür, dass Battlepacks 2020 noch eine UVP von 15 € hatten, ist das einfach nur frech. 16 € wären akzeptabel, ab unter 14 € kann man das Set bedenkenlos kaufen. Immerhin werden dafür ja jetzt die prozentualen Rabatte immer höher, also ist es mit etwas Geduld gewissermaßen nicht so schlimm. Abgesehen vom Preis ist es aber insgesamt ein gutes Battlepack, mich stören hauptsächlich nur die angemerkte Ungenauigkeit der Bedruckung auf den Helmen und der Captain Vaughn, bei ihm hätte einfach mehr drin sein können. Ansonsten würde ich die jetzige Phase von Lego Star Wars ab 2020 für Klonkriegsfans als die beste bezeichnen, auch wenn es noch immer viele Baustellen gibt. Mit Blick auf die 2024 kommenden Sets war es nie einfacher Phase II-Klone zu sammeln, geschweige denn in der aktuellen Vielfalt.","Reviewed in Germany on 18 September 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

(Para menor edad es LEGO DUPLO, a partir de 2 años). En el interior de la caja tenemos 3 piezas grandes sueltas y 3 bolsas con sus correspondientes piezas, estás, están identificadas por número para el montaje del Templo Jedi Tenoo. Este set contiene 3 manuales de montaje y en el interior de la bolsa 1, tenemos una cajita con 2 capas textiles Jedi.El montaje completo del set me ha llevado sobre media hora, eso sí, haciendo tranquilamente, este kit viene con 3 manuales que están muy bien explicados gráficamente, con imágenes y con la posición exacta de las piezas. Este modelo cuenta con 124 piezas (Dificultada: Fácil de montar), eso sí, un niño dependiendo de su edad tardará más o menos tiempo en el montaje.El resultado final es idéntico al de la caja, no hay diferencia, se ve claramente que la marca LEGO, es calidad, cada pieza importa (Todas ellas están identificadas con su código y número). Además, están muy bien realizadas con colores brillantes muy llamativos. Se nota que este producto está pensado para durar muchos años.De mano recomiendo este tipo de juguetes para todos los niños, debido a que inicialmente para jugar con ellos deben de montarlos y mientras lo hacen su imaginación se dispara y se vuelven muy creativos. Esto les permite a los más pequeños comprender el espacio, las dimensiones, proporciones, simetría. Esto hace que este tipo de juguetes realmente no tengan un límite de edad y siempre nos hagan recordar esos buenos momentos. (Yo el primero)* Recomendable para todos los niños, los no tan niños y los seguidores de STAR WARS** El manual número 1, contiene un código QR, este nos sirve para descargar la aplicación de LEGO (LEGO Builder), desde la aplicación podemos descargar un manual en formato PDF (Mismo que el de papel), pero lo más interesante es que desde la propia aplicación podemos efectuar el montaje paso a paso y visualizarlo en 3D, para poder ver el montaje de las piezas desde todos los ángulos posibles. Está muy bien, ya que permite ver zonas que en formato papel no son visibles.** Detalle: Es un kit de construcción muy original, ya que dispone de 3 figuras de STAR WARS (Maestro Yoda, Lys Solay y Kai Brightstar con sus correspondientes espadas láser, también tenemos un droide de entrenamiento y una moto jets.","Reviewed in Spain on 28 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"957","LEGO® Star Wars™ 332nd Ahsoka’s Clone Trooper™ Battle Pack 75359 Building Toy Set, Featuring Clone Captain Vaughn and a Stud-Shooting Speeder","Your typical Lego battle pack, but could have been better.","Anais Brouillet","Any Lego battle pack featuring clone troopers goes down well with me and my son, with both of us huge Star Wars fans. I do however question the choice of clone legion for this one, which comes hot on the heels of the recent 501st specialist pack. I expect that Lego have been somewhat lead by the current Ashoka show. Although there have been requests from the Lego Star Wars community for more of these 332nd troopers (previously only one was included in a now retired set), the legion is yet another offshoot of the 501st and saw only limited use right at the end of the clone wars. In reality we are crying out for battle packs featuring many other popular clone legions (such as Wolfpack, 327th, etc.) which featured much more in Star Wars media. Anyway, enough of my ranting!This set has a decent small build of a swamp speeder in 501st blue, albeit this vehicle hasn’t been seen in on screen action with these clones. It still looks pretty clean and can accommodate two of the clones. Stud shooters are integrated well for play value. The little turret / mortar is a bit basic though, surely they could have stretched to a few more pieces to make an E-web type design like in the snow trooper pack?!The figures match the new style clones with the helmet holes and a pack of visors and range finders are included for customisation options. Two of the clones have jet packs. One figure depicts Clone Captain Vaughn and sports a different torso, but they have neglected to include additional details on his torso and helmet which would have made him more unique and stand out from the other troopers. Vaughn of course has a visor and you can attach one to him (but it is bright orange and should have been darker as per his media depiction!)Overall, this is a fairly typical battle pack, the usual quality building experience and play value. I just wish that little bit more effort had been made to get Vaughn right, otherwise they would have been better including only rank and file troopers. The RRP of these packs has gradually crept upwards over the years, but be on the lookout for deals (I got this one with a £4 discount voucher which could be selected at checkout).","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 September 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars",NA

Por un lado tenemos obviamente a el Maestro Yoda y a sus dos padawans Lys Solay y Kai Brightstar.• El resto del set lo compone el propio templo con su vegetación exterior, y en el interior cuenta con dos camas literas con escalera y una pequeña cocina con algunos pequeños elementos como un brick de leche.• Ademas tenemos una plataforma para practicar el equilibrio, una gran roca para practicar la levitación con el poder de la fuerza, un androide de entrenamiento y una moto jet.🏗️ El montaje de este set es super sencillo y es indicado para niños a partir de 4 años. Si fuera necesario que no lo creo, contamos con útiles dos guías. Una de ellas tiene 35 paginas y nos muestra como ensamblar la plataforma de equilibrio y el androide de entrenamiento. Y la otra guía con 67 paginas nos muestra el ensamblado del Templo Tenoo.🏭 Todas las piezas, como nos tiene acostumbrados LEGO, están muy bien realizadas y pulidas, con colores vivos y uniformes, y unos plásticos resistentes con bordes suaves y sin rebabas. Totalmente seguros para los niños.🏆 Una vez montado los niños podrán jugar y montar sus propias aventuras. O los mas frikis y coleccionistas lo pueden exponer en algun lugar favorito de su casa.✅ Este LEGO de Star Wars es un set muy sencillo para que los niños comiencen a familiarizarse con construcciones mas avanzadas, sobre todo si vienen de juegos como DUPLO. Muy recomendable para los menores e incondicionales de la saga, ademas tiene un precio muy bueno.👍 Espero que esta revisión y mis comentarios os hayan resultado útiles y de ayuda 😇","Reviewed in Spain on 6 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Solitamente alle costruzioni LEGO assegno cinque stelle perché è praticamente impossibile trovare difetti, ma questa volta con sorpresa sia per voi che per me, sono costretta a fermarmi alle tre stelle. Questo perché, per quanto ho trovato geniale e divertente il playset in questione, non sono d’accordo con il prezzo di vendita: al momento questa scatolina da appena 124 pezzi ci viene venduta alla bellezza di €42,99.So bene che i LEGO hanno sempre prezzi importanti, ben giustificati dall’ottima qualità delle costruzioni e dalla notorietà del marchio, ma questa volta ritengo che il prezzo sia assolutamente eccessivo. Che si tratti di un errore? Chissà.Per quanto riguarda invece la destinazione del giocattolo, sono pienamente d’accordo con l’età consigliata dal venditore e cioè dai quattro anni in su, questo perché non si può rischiare con i bambini in quanto trattandosi di pezzi piuttosto piccoli, potrebbero malauguratamente essere ingeriti.Il set comprende 124 pezzi ognuno dei quali è finalizzato alla creazione di meravigliosi oggetti ricchi di dettagli.Come per tutti i set LEGO, anche per questo, la fantasia può creare storie infinite e non ci si annoia davvero mai. Questo LEGO in particolare, essendo destinato agli adulti, può essere un vero e proprio oggetto da esporre quindi come da collezione.Sembra quasi sciocco specificarlo, ma meglio essere precisi: il giocattolo LEGO arriva in una scatola originale, ricca di immagini, colori e informazioni, tra cui vi ricordo il certificato europeo sulla sicurezza dei materiali CE.Tutti i pezzi mi sono arrivati integri e senza alcun difetto di fabbricazione.Giocattolo super consigliato.Spero di essere stata imparziale, chiara, completa, ma soprattutto spero di avervi fornito tutte le informazioni necessarie per effettuare una scelta più consapevole, vi ringrazio per aver letto la mia recensione,Alessia","Reviewed in Italy on 7 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA

"984","LEGO® Star Wars™ 332nd Ahsoka’s Clone Trooper™ Battle Pack 75359 Building Toy Set, Featuring Clone Captain Vaughn and a Stud-Shooting Speeder","Not as good as it could have been…","Jo Rod Pi","My family and I are absolutely huge Lego fans. We have a collection between us worth literally thousands of pounds and are always on the lookout to add to our ever growing sets. In particular, we have always been fans of the Star Wars series so when this new set became available we jumped at the chance to add it to the collection. Now, whilst I would usually gush and wax lyrical about how wonderful the new set is, on this occasion I find myself in the rather unusual position of having some mixed feelings about the overall experience of the set. Let me explain why…First of all let’s begin with price. It’s no surprise given the rising cost of pretty much everything these days that this set appears to be pretty expensive considering what you get for all those hard earned pennies. Priced at £36.99 (at time of review) for just 124 pieces that works out to be just under £0.30 pence per piece. That’s steep, even by Lego’s standard. You receive 3 figures in the set although I will add that as the set is aimed at a younger audience the figures come with child (small) legs and facial expressions to match. The set is pretty easy to build and instructions, as always, are clear, concise and easy to follow. Particularly young builders may need a little adult supervision, but most children should be able to follow along and construct nearly all the build themselves. One great feature of this set is that there are no frustrating stickers to be applied here, something Lego is often criticised for. Rather, all the elements have been printed with their relevant markings at point of manufacture.There is a reasonable amount of re-build options and of course a huge plethora of imaginative play scenarios to be had with this set. I do feel Lego could have done a little better though in a few places, for example, the bunk bed is a pretty basic build and neither looks inspiring nor did it invoke a lot of play from my youngest children. The levitating boulder lost its fun and appeal and the balance blocks were all too quickly discarded. Those parts aside though, the main ‘building’ itself looks pretty good and the parts and layout allow for you to build onto the scene using any of your own bricks.All in all, as much of a fan of Lego and Star Wars as I am, I just feel here that Lego have priced this set far too high for what it is and for what you actually get. For me, I would suggest a fairer price point of somewhere around the £25 mark would have been more realistic and provide better value for your hard earned money. Is it a potential investment or future collectors piece? I personally don’t believe so. Full sized sets and their equivalent full sized mini-figures tend to command a much higher re-sale value. I am sorry to say it here but this set, at least for me, just doesn’t warrant your consideration. Unusually for me, I am going to give this set just three stars. One off for price and another off for longevity and playability. Lego have so many better sets out there in this price bracket that offer better value on a pence per part ratio. For those reasons I wouldn’t recommend this set and suggest you look elsewhere in the humongous Lego catalogue for your next bricky purchase.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 July 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Se ha combertido en un objetivo, y con Lego, mi sueño se está haciendo realidad.La serigrafía y la calidad de acabados me parecen sorprendentes. En la propia caja se ve que estamos delante de un producto de calidad, muy bien acabado y que va a acabar expuesto en mi habitación, ya que llena mucho construir juguetes y sentirlos como propios cuando ya están acabados. Esa sensación es la misma que tenía en antaño, y que la he vuelto a tener. Quiero que también la tenga mi hijo cuando vaya creciendo y espero que cuide esta oportunidad como lo llevo haciendo yo toda la vida.En este caso, estamos delante de un Lego de Star Wars, el Templo Tenoo donde aparece el maestro Yoda enseñando a unos jóvenes padawan para convertirse en unos Jedi. Aparece también un droide para entrenarlos, algo que me parece muy mono.Me parece muy recomendable y muy bonito de ver.","Reviewed in Spain on 5 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars",NA

"1001","Under Armour Men's UA Surge 3","I love these","S","These shoes are versatile- good for walking or running or other kinds of sport, they’re comfortable and quite lightweight, I run in these but I’d say there are better running shoes. I’ve had in the past. Although I’d buy another pair in a different colour. Maybe the black and white or grey. They fit me well and the white colour I got looks nice. Better than any of the photos advertised really. They do stain easily but as long as you clean them straight away when you get home it’s alright. They’re quite bendy and give a sort of boost when you jump in them which is nice. Good shoes","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 October 2023","4.5 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

These bad boys are like a covert operation for your toes, delivering stealthy comfort and style that'll make you feel like a ninja on a mission to conquer the world (or at least the neighborhood basketball court).First things first, let's talk about the blackness of these shoes. They're so black, they make the night sky jealous. It's like strapping a pair of mini black holes to your feet, ready to absorb all the attention and keep your fashion game on point.

The moment you slip them on, you'll feel like your feet are being hugged by a squadron of baby kittens. It's a blissful experience that'll have you wondering why you haven't been wearing these shoes since birth.And the performance? Oh boy, get ready to unleash your inner sports superstar. With their advanced technology and built-in superpowers (okay, maybe not superpowers, but close enough), these shoes will have you jumping higher, running faster, and pivoting with the agility of a gazelle on roller skates. Your opponents won't know what hit them as you leave them in the dust, questioning their life choices.But wait, there's more! These shoes are like the secret agents of the sneaker world—they're lightweight, durable, and ready to take on any challenge.

"1048","Under Armour Men's UA Surge 3","They're very good value, but not really RUNNING shoes.","Marina","I bought these as a punt. I saw the price and knew that it would be very difficult to find a proper running shoe for under £100 / $150 (actually for running). The inner cushioning is okay 7/10. Not as good as my actual running shoes made by Puma. The outer is much stiffer 6/10. So, what are you buying these for? If you want running shoes, buy an actual pair of good high technology running shoes, and expect to pay 3 times this easily. You wont injure yourself with good proper runners gear. Your knees wont hurt as much from every impact, and you will be less likely to get shin splints. You will be more likely to actually get fit, because you won't stop from daily aches and occasional hard impact injuries. But ... If you want comfortable shoes for daily urban walks, these are fantastic. The price is amazing for just comfortable daily non-running workouts.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 December 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I have bought several pair because I enjoy them for different uses and they are priced great but with heavy use they will break down and your feet will tend to roll either to the inside or outside depending on how the insole is set inside the shoe.  That is one area that could use improvement because the insole doesn't provide a ton of cushioning or support and will shift somewhat over time.

"1163","Under Armour","Good little shoes","Chati","Bought these to jog and walk in. They are a pretty decent pair of shoes. They are lightweight and relatively comfy after you break them in. For the first couple weeks they were hard on my heels. Nothing a couple bandaids or k tape couldn’t fix! Now that they are broken in, they are a dream. They keep your feet nice and cool for hot runs or hot summer days when you’re out walking. I think once mine bite the dust, I will definitely order again! I gave 4 stars because of the rough beginning and because the sizing is a bit off. After reading other reviews and checking out the size chart on the website, I decided to order half size up and I’m glad I did. They do fit a bit small.","Reviewed in France on 31 August 2023","3.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They feel like an extension of my feet, allowing me to focus on my stride and pace without feeling weighed down. The breathability of the materials is also a standout feature, keeping my feet cool and dry even during intense workouts.Overall, I highly recommend these running trainers to anyone who is serious about their fitness goals. They are stylish, comfortable, and most importantly, provide the performance necessary to push yourself to new heights.

"1175","Under Armour","great shoes but sizing has changed over the years","Jessy","I bought a pair of these runners at a bricks & mortar store in size 11.5 a year or two ago and they have been great; comfortable and durable. They are still usable but starting to go so I thought I would order new ones when they were on sale for under 50$ in October 2023. Good deal. Unfortunately, despite receiving size 11.5 again, these shoes were smaller this time. It wasn't just that the old ones had stretched from use, of course they did.  But my toes were crushed into the end of these new shoes, quite uncomfortably so, and there is no way they would fit with wear. The same size was simply smaller now. They felt like a size 11. Perhaps over the years there has been a change in factory or out-sourcing the shoe manufacturing etc...  End result, I had to send them back and they went back to the normal price @ $95.So as other reviews have warned, buy a half size larger than you normally wear.","Reviewed in Mexico on 7 December 2023","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1188","Under Armour","On the slim side","Alain","I recently purchased a pair of tennis shoes for my active lifestyle, and I have been impressed with their overall performance and versatility. In this review, I will share my experiences and thoughts on these tennis shoes, highlighting their comfort, durability, and suitability for various activities.Comfort and Fit:One of the standout features of these tennis shoes is their exceptional comfort. The shoes are well-padded and provide ample cushioning, making them comfortable to wear for extended periods. The supportive insoles and arch design offer great stability and help reduce fatigue during physical activities. Additionally, the shoes have a snug fit that conforms to the shape of my feet, ensuring a secure and comfortable feel throughout the day.Durability and Quality:These tennis shoes are built to last. The materials used in their construction are of high quality, exhibiting excellent durability. The reinforced stitching and sturdy outsole provide resistance against wear and tear, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. Whether I'm playing tennis, going for a run, or simply walking around, these shoes have held up well and shown no signs of premature damage.Versatility:The versatility of these tennis shoes is worth highlighting. While they are designed primarily for tennis, they can easily be used for various other activities, such as walking, jogging, or light workouts. The shoes offer excellent traction, allowing for stability and grip on different surfaces. Whether on the tennis court or on the pavement, I feel confident in these shoes' performance.Breathability and Moisture Control:Another noteworthy aspect of these tennis shoes is their breathability. The upper mesh material allows for proper airflow, keeping my feet cool and preventing excessive sweating. This feature is particularly beneficial during intense physical activities, as it helps maintain comfort and reduces the risk of unpleasant odors.Style and Aesthetics:While performance is key, aesthetics also play a role in choosing footwear. These tennis shoes strike a good balance between functionality and style. They come in various color options, catering to different preferences. The sleek design and clean lines make them visually appealing, allowing me to wear them not only during athletic activities but also in casual settings.Conclusion:In conclusion, these tennis shoes offer a comfortable and versatile option for those seeking reliable footwear for active pursuits. Their comfort, durability, and adaptability to different activities make them a solid choice. The shoes provide a snug fit and excellent cushioning, ensuring comfort even during long hours of wear. Their high-quality construction ensures long-lasting performance, while the breathability feature adds to their overall comfort. With their appealing design, these tennis shoes are suitable not only for sports but also for everyday casual wear. I recommend considering these tennis shoes for anyone in need of reliable, comfortable, and versatile footwear.","Reviewed in France on 23 August 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Have bought other UA trainers before but these are much more hardwearing and have not split or torn after being worn everyday for the last few months.  They are still lightweight and have been used while he plays many different sports.  Material also means they are far more showerproof than other trainers he has had.

The pics are from today.  Stitching is in great shape and there's still lots of tread left.  It's not an aggressive tread design so these might be more suitable for walking than heavy duty trail running.  They're comfortable and I'm so glad I didn't buy cheap shoes.I've walked/jogged in these almost every day for the 2 weeks I've had them.  I checked out a bunch of cheaper shoes that had spiffy pics but only so-so reviews and felt I should spend a bit more to get a quality shoe.  Life is too short for cheap shoes.  Anyways, they fit well and they feel good, and I've had no issues with my feet yet.  Of course, I've only had them for 2 weeks so I can't speak about their durability.

So I went shopping for another pair of shoes in that style and let me tell you this pair was awesome and they are just as comfy and great quality as any top shoe brand ie:(Nike). I’ve had them about a month now and they are extremely comfortable and are built very well. I hope in the near future they still have this for this price or even better at a lower price would be awesome. I have a wide foot and I can fit in most shoes no problem but when I seen they had a 13w I was so stoked so I ordered they came in a week wish it was two day prime but they still got here and they are true to what they offer for size. Probably going to be the only show I will keep buying and wearing for years to come just wish they had all black in 13w.

Although I do need to tie laces differently.","Tartaro Servicios Editoriales","Update: I guess I have a tall left foot (cartilage \ bones) I have to skip one crossover with the laces, midway up or that foot starts to really hurt. There is are really good webpages showing different shoe lacing techniques (I used info from Rick's sporting goods website). Still 5 stars for these shoes.My feet measure: 10.5"" long x 4"" wide & I'm flat-footed (always).These in Size 10 fit me very well in width, but a bit of extra wiggle room for my toes. I might have been able to go with size 9.5, but I didn't want to risk the return shipping times (long! due to covid-19).I am replacing a pair of Charged Assert 6 which I bought from a thrift store late last year (2019), they were made in Indonesia, January 2017. Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn until putting on these brand new Assert 8s (made in Vietnam, February 2020).I'm in my late 40s, most of my life I'd go to Academy & buy a pair of basic white Nike sneakers, without trying on other brands or styles, I loathed shopping. (Nike has given me more than enough reason to never give them my money again). With the quality and comfort of my 'well used' thrift store Assert 6s I feel I have made a great purchase at this price point. Also feels like I have been cheating myself, my feet & lower back for several decades, but that (& Nike) are in my past.I'm a walker not a runner so I can't say if they are 'good' for you running types. I have walked several hundred miles in my old pair, I'm certain these new 8th gens will perform just as well along with looking much better. ;-)","Reviewed in the United States on 9 June 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They were slightly heavier than my first pair of UA running shoes but that was only noticeable when I first put on.I found they had a great grip. Running through the winter I barely slipped at all on snow or ice (care taken of course). This included on inclines and gave me confidence keeping some sensible pace despite the weather conditions.They lasted very well too. The cushioning at the heel started to wear at around 1000km but they only became uncomfortable after 1500km when the inner arch seam between the upper and sole started to split.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Reason being, I am in a bad habit of leaving my trainers laced up, then when I go out I simply slip the trainers on & off I pop, however...the backs are softer than other trainers I have and fold a bit when trying to slide them on.

Size if fit as usual.","Sean","Someone in the review said the pair was tighter than usual but others said its fit as usual.For me, it’s fit as usual despite it’s a bit tight at the heel side. I guess it’s the design to protect your heel in workout. The overall comment is positive. Price-to-quality ratio is high comparing to Nike and adidas. The glue traces at the edge is real just like others mentioned in review, but you won’t even notice it if you are not particularly looking for it.Will be a return-customer for UA.

"1515","Caterpillar","This Amazon traded product is genuine and as fantastic as Caterpillar ever are!","George Stock","I wear Caterpillar boots to support my ankles, instead of having ugly medical supports, but also as a fashion statement. They are the only make that suit my wide feet,  that are misshapen because of my EDS, a bleeding and collagen disorder, ie. toes twisted and big toe joint enlarged and twisted.I have a range of CAT boots in different colours and had never tried the Colorado style before.Absolutely fantastic.  I put them on two days ago, and wore them the rest of the day! (I have to wear boots inside and continually anyway, while up and about!. Sheer bliss! The leather is strong with a protective coat so shed water and Nikwax spray so do not bother to use it! They are strong and have protective toes caps, but also amazingly comfortable, immaculate condition on arrival, and look amazing with fairly tight jeans and slim legs!You can ignore most of this review but rest assured that these are not fake, as said by some. Bought direct from Amazon, they were as described and genuine. They have a product serial number and age, came with a scan image, have genuine labels sewn in which are identical to their normal ones etc. and I should know.I bought men's wide, hooping that they would be snug around the ankles. They are.Though much of the rCaterpillar ange in women's and men's are chunky by normal leisure standards, but if you are used to walking boots rather than strappy sandals,  do a lot of minor  or walks outside, or work manually, then you. would love them.I have only ever worn out one pair of cCterpillars to the extent that they are stained and scruffy. IThey were second hand though! I have tried Doc Martens, which are good and more a fashion item, especially for students, but the fit is not right for me.I judge by the soles and not the design in general, as it is a better predictor of a wide fit.  They need to be fairly rigid and tough to prevent stones from digging in one's feet, etc. Even if you are in the range of normal for footwear, a non-wide fit pair are roomy and comfortable, but I have to stretch those for above reasons, and they do not improve my balance as much as the wider soles.  (If. you know someone with EDS, then they may think along the same lines as me as I want to keep on my feet for as long as possible and have regular ligament tears to recover from. .I get so many compliments about my bright blue boots and my yellow ones. I would like some pink ones but have never found them at reduced price in my size!!!

Sadly after only wearing boots three times one of the lace eyelets fell off and the boots were returned and replacement pair sent out to us. This was the first time I had returned any items to Amazon but process proved to be quite simple. Hoping replacement pair will not have the same problem.

Sono molto comode e tengono il piede al caldo, l'ideale per chi come me è abituato a camminare molto, anche d'inverno.Per quel che riguarda la taglia, io ho optato per un numero in meno alla mia misura, quindi un 42 invece del 43 che porto solitamente, la scarpa ha inoltre il pregio di fasciare molto bene il piede.In definitiva un ottimo acquisto, che sicuramente ripeterò in futuro e che pertanto consiglio a chi è in cerca degli scarponcini comodi, ben fatti e resistenti.","Reviewed in Italy on 10 October 2014","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I absolutely love them","Brian B.","I bought these pants at the beginning of fall, and absolutely love them!  Its now the end of February and these pants have not let me down. I always just wore jeans for work before. Have done so for 20+ years. After getting these its all i wear. I probably wore my jeans only a handful of times since, because the cat pants were officially dirty. I say officially because i swear these things repel dirt and dust, not to mention they seem to be water repellent! I'm a in house tile setter for a local builder, i do most of our showers and tile work. I also do carpentry,  and operate our hook truck (dumpster hauling) when I'm inbetween tile projects. I also have my hoist and can operate machinery (2a/3c) Before I bought these pants I would dress a bit different depending on what I was doing. Since wearing them for the first time I've fallen in love with them. If im working, be it around the house or professionally;  I'm wearing my cat pants. I do not always use the pouches, and when tucked away you forget they are even their. The pouches are made from a thinner material, but it seems strong. I do try to be careful with sharp tools. My favorite use for them is for my spacers though! They are perfect for tile setting. You can easily have your knife, 5in1, nippers, and spacers all on you comfortably, plus room for a few other things. Thats just in the pouches! The pockets are awesome too. So many. Everybody will have a different use for each one.  Seems like each pocket was made for particular items like a calculator, nailsets, catspaw, wallet, and a few more! I don't use the knee pads yet, but I will sooner or later. I have proknee knee pads which i prefer for most stuff. However I think the inserts will definitely be useful doing odds and ends where i am up and down alot. Ive just not needed them yet. As i mentioned earlier the pants seem to repel dirt, water and dust. No doubt, if you get grout or thinset or the water from cleaning either its going to stick to the pants, but it washes off easily.  I'm a very neat installer and tend to keep clean. I'll wash it off as i go and avoid making a mess to begin with.  if you are a messy tradesman then they probably wont help you in that department. If you are like me and like to keep clean they are great! Ive worn the same pair of pants 5-7 days a week washing only when needed but typically no more then one or two times a week. If when i pat them, dust comes off, or if they look dirty ill wash them. When i wore jeans i had to wear a fresh pair every day! When i first got them i told the wife we will probably wanna get a second pair because i couldn't go back to jeans after wearing them, lol. But keeping them clean has been a non issue. I am a very particular person. Clean clothing is a must for me. So i am not sacrificing my cleanliness to wear them in this fashion.  I have also wore them in a few snowstorms and a blizzard shoveling.  During the first storm i didn't wanna wear the cat pants cause i wanted to save them for work, so i wore my jeans. When i came back in they were soaked like jeans always do. I was froze. It sucked as usual.  The cat pants are a bit on the thick side, so i decided to try them out on the next trip out, and wow what difference!  No layer, just pants, and i was fine. It was 25 degrees wind and snowing. Pants barely soaked any water up. After that i always just wore the cat pants for snow removal too. I find the pants to fit well based on the size chart. I have the us 36/34 w/L for the cat pants and before that i always wore dickies 34/32. My dickies fit snug/boarder on tite. Were as the cat pants are a bit loose. I may try the next size down on my next pair. I was more afraid of them being to tight.All in all; the bottom line is: GET THE PANTS, THEY EFFING ROCK!! lol. Game changers. Everyone who seems them, loves them. If you are looking at these for someone else as a gift or whatever, buy them! They will love them!  Any tradesman will enjoy these pants.  Even the guys who still love the overalls will love these pants too!","Reviewed in the United States on 25 February 2017","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1620","Caterpillar Men's Cargo Pant with Holster","Very satisfied just what I needed","Joe","After wearing these pants for 2 weeks for work I've got to say for the price of them they are great and just what I needed. Tons of pockets on the pants for storage of tools and small parts which is a big plus for me. They are made tough for everyday work, the material is thick and can get a bit warm especially with knee pads in them. There isn't a whole lot of stretch to them either. Sizing is as expected, I ordered a size up to be safe and I still have room in the waist which isn't a problem with a belt. Only real complaint about them would be that the length is fine but they are a bit baggy and the knee pad pockets are lower on the knee. When kneeling knees tend to miss the knee pad inserts, so I always just pull them up before I kneel down and the knee pads slide around inside pockets when kneeling at times. Overall very satisfied with quality and practicality of the pants and highly recommend them as a cheaper alternative to other higher priced brand names, I also bought the caterpillar knee pad inserts to go with these as well.","Reviewed in Canada on 5 March 2020","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1622","Caterpillar Men's Cargo Pant with Holster","LOVE THESE! Size is a little off!","Bhi","Pants are Awesome. I have bad knees and bought solely for the knee pad compatibility. Pockets by the knee are a little off, as anyone knows, if you put stuff in pockets that are at your knees its very awkward to kneel. that would be the only down fall. The other thing is wear a size 34 waist and always have. I have a pair of the Cat. H20 Defenders pants which I love also. I order them in a size 34 and they fit great. 34 though in these were SO tight I had return and get a 36 and now they are slightly loose but not too bad. So I would recommend getting a size bigger on the trademark pants! I ordered 5 pairs though after getting the right fit. These are great quality and I feel will last forever. I love the attached pockets in the front, eliminates a work belt half the time now!Def. Recommend these.. along with the H20 Defenders.** I plan on wearing these during winter and they are heavy material and using the H20 Defender during the summer as the material on those are much lighter.","Reviewed in the United States on 18 February 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"1623","Caterpillar Men's Cargo Pant with Holster","Comfortable, flexible, temperate","Zach","I have been wearing these pants for a few years now, on my 3rd pair. Very much like this pants, they are, at least to me, extremely comfortable. I work for a major retailer so lots of use and abuse walking around, kneeling down, impacts, cuts, etc. Pants hold up very well on the outside for around a year or so, they are very good year round in 100 degrees during summer all the way to negatives in the winter, I wear my pants a little baggy and long so size fit was perfect for the pants themselves.Some of the main problems of these that I've ran into was the kneepad inserts are never directly centered over the knee with just general walking around then kneeling, so I'm very often having to pull my pants taut and manually center it instead of being able to quickly drop to a knee. Also on the topic of kneepads is, as shown in the second picture, the fabric underneath is very thin and often tears at the seam at the top of the pocket. Not a huge deal as it hasn't compromised any strength of the pants and the kneepad still stays in, but obviously creates a draft which in winter can be a bit chilly, also makes putting in and pulling out the insert kind of annoying. I am running the Cat kneepad inserts designed for the pants, so its not an aftermarket insert causing problems.The fabric does get worn through in places after a while. In the first picture are holes from my phone being in the pocket, which is the lower hole, and a hole from the keys I would carry around at work. The carabiner scraping against the fabric eventually starting ripping a hole through it which I tried to remedy with some Gear Aid tape. It helped in that scenario but other areas not so much. Another place that rubbed holes was by my ankles where the pant legs rub together which isn't a big deal but it is a point of contact to be aware of. Another area being the 3rd picture, one of the belt loops the stitching came loose after about a year, it still held on to a few stitches but that is the place I hang my personal keys from so was worrying that it might tear all the way off and me lose my keys. One last problem, the 2nd pair I got had a loose button for the pants, so under the force of my belt it would push backward into my waist and cause some pain and annoyance.That's about it for the bads, so for some goods. As stated in the first paragraph, very comfortable. I'd say they fit exactly how I prefer to have pants fit but obviously everyone has different tastes. They do come feeling a little stiff but after a couple days of working and a wash or two they get extremely flexible. Has many, many pockets for carrying various stuff, all my regular work carry stuff like multi-tool, flash light, headphones, phone, keys, wallet, etc. But also lots of other space, I dedicated one of the pockets to my work device, can carry any meds in a different pocket. The velcro on 2 of the belt loops is VERY strong which can sometimes be obnoxious to undo but I'd say more of a positive than a negative. Obviously for a work pants theres a hammer loop for anyone who might need that. The pullout pockets work great for separating stuff as they have plenty of room for nails, tape, screwdrivers, etc. Seem like they'd be very good pants for roofing work although I haven't done any of that in them.All in all, I do very much recommend this pant as they put up to the 8 hours a day use and abuse I put them through, just be cautious of them tearing through at certain places.","Reviewed in the United States on 8 March 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1625","Caterpillar Men's Cargo Pant with Holster","Great functionality, fit a bit weird.","Deven james schmidt","These pants have been awesome. I'm a finish carpenter and so sometimes the full belt isn't required. Great to have lots of places to store pencils, tape, a little combo square.Also, the knee pad pockets are a godsend. No more elastics cutting into the backs of your knees, and you've always got them.Material is really ruggedMy only cons: the hammer loop is useless, it's too low. I end up carrying my hammer or putting on a belt with just a hammer loop. And the fit is weird. They fit smaller than regular pants, but about on par with other work pants. I recommend going 4""-6"" up from your Jean size.  They are also nearly drop crotch.

I usually wear a 36w - 32l. At that size I need a belt and are a tad too long. I ordered these at 36w - 30l. They fit perfect. I've been looking at other work pants options and went with these first. Don't think I will try the others.  I will just get more of these. They look nice, they feel nice, they are sturdy, and perfect for when I'm out doing projects.The ONE gripe I have is the knee pad placement. Knee pads would be worthless as they don't come close to lining up on the body. They would be shin guards instead as they run way low of the knee. If you need them specifically because you are on your knees constantly, then these aren't your pants.

I bought 1 pair to try and then I bought 2 pairs from Tractor Supply because they're about $20 cheaper. The knee pads do sit low, like others stated. They should be up an inch or 2 higher. But regardless when dropping a knee your padded. But when walking around they're more of a shin guard. Also like some stated the waste band does not have that much movement at all.

"1653","Caterpillar H2O Defender Pant","Great for physical and dirty work.","JOE","I work outside 70% of the time at my current job.  I bought these for those days when its a mist to light spotty rain.  They do deflect a good amount of LIGHT exposure to rain.  When it pours I doubt they would keep you really dry and I have not put them to that test. I would be in wet pants the rest of the work day if they failed.  During heavy rains, I don't work or I put on a rain suit.PROS--  Tough material that should stand up to abuse well.  Also somewhat water resistant.  ---  Fit exactly as sized.  I'm a 36w 32L in virtually every pant known, I ordered that size and it fit perfectly.  ----Knee's are reinforced and have knee pad pockets.  If you kneel at work, get the pads!  I stuffed some off brand pads in to try out and they worked ok.  -----  Cool pocket pouches that turn into instant light duty tool rigs.  ------reinforced cuffs that should extend pant's lifeCONS  ---So far only one and that is the material holds a static charge.  I worked in a dirty persons house who had multiple shedding animals and had given up on vacuuming.  I was covered in pet hair when I completed my job.  I had to use 5 sheets on a lint roller to de-hair the pants.  Something about the material makes hair, sawdust, regular dust and just about any air borne particle stick to them.  I have only worn and washed them once, so maybe that will change, but I think it has something to do with the waterproofing of the fabric.I bought one pair to try out, I'll be buying more.","Reviewed in the United States on 6 December 2016","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I feel this is to keep pants around your waist....so if you have a bit of a belly you may want to go up a size or two accordingly.  Also, knee pad inserts are not included, but tool pouches are.Was very impressed with the stitching.  The seam in the rear is triple sewn.  The reinforced areas all feature double stitching.  There are rear and front snap buttons to attach pouches so that they stay secure and supported.  The engineering is spot on.  Not very warm feeling, if you work outdoors you will want to wear thermals under these.

It’s a great idea and would be useful if they actually held.They attach and detach via snap buttons.  However, they do not hold tight at all and while you can put small materials such as nails, staples, wire nuts, etc in them, reaching in to get them out will likely result in detaching the pocket entirely.So while the pants are great, those material pockets are simply a good idea poorly executed.","Reviewed in the United States on 5 June 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Keep my tape and knife and bits in them and just pull the pockets off at the end of the day and put them in my toolbox or passenger seat.

"1752","Caterpillar Men's Colorado Boots","As good as ever - just for some reason larger than previous pairs","Donald","I've been buying CAT boots and particularly the Colorado for over fifteen years now (this is my third pair of Colorados) and was disappointed to find when I went to buy another pair to find that they are no longer available here in the United Kingdom.When buying them in the UK they fitted perfectly from the start (no breaking in), but I found this pair - bought from the United States, were slightly too large even though I was careful to get (UK) size 11 (narrow fit). For this reason I’m knocking one star off what would otherwise be a perfect five.I'm not sure why this was the case but it was slightly disappointing.Apart from that; these show the usual Caterpillar quality and look as good as ever. They’re big (not just for size 11s) and heavy, but if you’re happy with that they shouldn’t disappoint.Just a note – I’ve had two pairs of Colorados in fifteen years but they were worn all day, every day – they are satisfactorily rugged!","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 October 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Primi stivali Caterpillar che acquisto e sono rimasto soddisfatto. Tolgo una stella perché le misure non sono nella norma e non viene menzionato nulla in descrizione per aiutare il cliente a scegliere la misura adatta, costringendolo ad una sostituzione con conseguente spiacevole perdita di tempo.

"1792","Caterpillar Men's Colorado Boots","Caterpillar Colorado","Error","Je suis un inconditionnel de ce modèle de Caterpillar (quatrième paire en 20 ans) qui sont idéales pour les froides et pluvieuses journées d'hiver.Suite à une très bonne promotion sur le site d'Amazon de plus de 50% en septembre (70 € au lieu de 150€), je me suis laissé tenter et fait l'acquisition de ce modèle Caterpillar Colorado noir en pointure 45.Cependant, une petite déconvenue lors de la première utilisation. En effet, un crochet servant à maintenir un des lacets s'est désolidarisé du cuir en voulant lacer la chaussures rendant cette dernière (provisoirement) inutilisable. Ayant acheté ces chaussures en septembre et les ayant réellement porté (tout au moins essayé de le faire) la première fois en novembre, j'ai laissé passé le mois de retour pour échange ou remboursement possible par Amazon. Ainsi, j'ai malgré tout téléphoné à Amazon qui n'a rien pu faire (délai d'un mois permettant le retour ayant expiré) mis à part un geste commercial d'un bon d'achat de 5€ pour la gêne occasionnée. Suite à cela, je suis allé chez un cordonnier qui m'a remplacé le crochet et cela m'a coûté 2 €. Donc, et même si le crochet n'est pas tout à fait identique (ce qui n'est pas trop grave car cette partie de la chaussure est souvent cachée par un bas de pantalon), je m'en tire bien et je vais enfin pouvoir les porter.Mais à l'avenir je vais tester, essayer, inspecter et porter les chaussures commandées pendant un mois pour ne pas laisser bêtement passer la possibilité de retourner un article défectueux.En conclusion, je ne recommande pas ce modèle car je suis déçu par ces chaussures Caterpillar Colorado dont la qualité a clairement baissé (quel comble vu le prix conseillé de 150€ sur le site Amazon) semble ne plus être la même qu'auparavant (crochet qui a sauté à la première vraie utilisation, cela ne m'était jamais arrivé sur les précédents modèles qui pourtant en ont vu durant toute leur utilisation) et les matériaux semblent être différents (mais cela est purement subjectif) de ceux utilisés auparavant sur un précédent modèle (notamment la semelle du présent modèle qui est faite d'un plastique dur et brillant alors qu'avant c'était un plastique mat type de celui utilisé pour les pneus). On verra à l'usage et avec le temps si ces chaussures me durent plus de 5 ans sans déconvenues.","Reviewed in France on 10 December 2016","2.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Which matters when you are on concrete for much of the day, I am using them on 59 year old feet and with that will always have times that during the day are uncomfortable. Still i do like them somewhat. They offer some cold protection only I noticed cold will work through from the soles, I was standing in place outside for a time yesterday and had to keep shifting weight and lifting my feet because the asphalt was freezing cold. Once you are moving everything seems okay. I coated my boots with mink oil since its winter in New England and our warmer winters are bringing a more wet snow than used to be. (This was just to add a second outside layer of water protection). I work from on my knees quite a bit and the sole of the boot has an extra flex feature which allows the foot to curl up more than conventional boots which is good for overall comfort while performing on the ground work.  Will mention that they do come large in size and I plan to buy more pairs while dropping down a half size at a time until they fit to perfection.  I will use this larger pair for winter to allow room for thermal socks and use a tighter fitting pair for summer work with lighter weight socks. I would buy more pairs because I will always need more work boots.","Reviewed in the United States on 21 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1921","Caterpillar Men's Diagnostic Steel-Toe Waterproof Boot,Dark","Sized Big but Manageable","$100 Bill","One year and still testing. I needed some heavy duty steel toes for logging and splitting. I burn wood for heat and have to deal with chainsaws, tractor, hills, and large logs rolling down and falling on my ankles and toes. Working in wet woodlands with dew and rain has put these to the test. So far they have proven that they are up to the job. No wetness, not even sweat, which pleases me much. They don't seem to be as heavy as my previous boots and seem to be more stable on the hills with good traction. Good support on the ankle also. They do run large. I have always worn an 8 1/2 W or EE in everything. The toe box is huge and so is the rest of the foot area, but that is resolved with extra heavy wool socks. All in all, they are very comfortable on my feet and I am not foot sore after 4 hours of strenuous wear.

"1924","Caterpillar Men's Diagnostic Steel-Toe Waterproof Boot,Dark","Great boots, but they do have a moderate arch","JCA","I really wanted to like these boots, but they just don't work for my feet.  I made it about five minutes before needing to take them off.  Definitely not Caterpillar's fault... these boots look nice and seem to be of great quality.  I just have funny feet.I did my research beforehand, looking specifically for steel toe boots that will work with feet that are both wide and flat.  These boots nail the 'wide' part 100%, at least in the toe area.  I've had problems with steel toe boxes being too small before, grinding into the side of my toes with each step, but I had plenty of room to move my toes around when I tried these on (even wearing thick wool socks!).Unfortunately, 'flat' is where I ran into a problem.  Several reviews from fellow flat-footed purchasers were encouraging.  Unfortunately for me, these boots narrow a bit behind the toe box and do provide moderate arch support.  Usually that's a good thing, but I have wide feet that are REALLY flat.  Like, when I get out of the pool my wet footprints look like fake Bigfoot impressions on the concrete... no arch, no gap at all.  If you look at an arch-side view of the boot you can see where the sole has a curve in it.  After reading reviews I was hopeful it was just there for appearance sake and they were wider and flatter inside than Kansas.  Nope... that's actual arch support molded into the sole itself, and with the construction method used on these boots it will never sink to conform to my flipper-like feet.The search continues...","Reviewed in the United States on 15 July 2015","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"1925","Caterpillar Men's Diagnostic Steel-Toe Waterproof Boot,Dark","----- Caterpillar Men's Diagnostic Steel-Toe Waterproof Work Boot ---------","Marcus Meyer","Purchased these roughly a week ago, boots aren't really even broken in yet, however based off of my 8hr work day experiences here is a quick review:Pro: These boots look pretty good, quality seems on par with Cat products (minus being made in China) which means they should last a good couple years of abuse.  The tread isn't aggressive, resulting in a more comfortable walking experience.  If you work in area that demands superior traction with aggressive tread for grip, these are NOT for you.  However if you work on flat to standard street surfaces these boots should work well traction wise while not punishing your feet with aggressive tread.  Overall @ $100 these boots so far have performed nicely at a very reasonable price.Cons: Made in China, which I know is pretty standard but I haven't had much luck with footwear produced from there.  Your a walking billboard for Cat with all the Caterpillar labels.  The eyelets and shoelace hooks appear to be on the cheap end with the hooks having sharp corners.  So far hasn't been an issue but we'll see if they wear the laces out quicker.  Bought inserts day one after wearing for a few hours, the support is lacking so a good insert is a MUST.  Doesn't have the ankle support I'm used to which will take some getting used to, for most people it should be adequate however for my taste it's not.Summary: I'd recommend these boots due to price point, appearance and less aggressive traction for day to day usage that doesn't require extreme traction.  So far so good :)","Reviewed in the United States on 15 February 2015","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It's not like wearing loggers where you have a 3"" steel shank in your heel and you're on your toes, way better that the ""running shoe"" style work boots too as in these don't step on a rock and blow out your ankle, the support tightens right up when you pull the laces.","Reviewed in the United States on 10 April 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

A month of intense usage to break in fully, the tread is a bit low after two months but as expected with as much as I move around in them, but they were worth the price.

(incredible when carrying half my weight on my shoulder and climbing stairs)Cons: Not good with long term use of shovels because the tread comes off easilyNo longer waterproof after two monthsThese boots were made for the men and women who sit in the machines and not so much for the workers on the groundExtra Notes:Measure your feet properly from longest points (tip of big toe to back of heel) and take away half an inch (IF BUYING WIDE BOOT)I work irrigation and landscaping and these boots work just fine for now.","Reviewed in the United States on 16 September 2017","4.5 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"1934","Caterpillar Men's Diagnostic Steel-Toe Waterproof Boot,Dark","EXCELLENT safety boots!","John P. Epperson Jr.","These boots were ordered because I injured my toes cutting wood after Hurricane Sandy felled one of our trees.  I was using safety equipment while using my chainsaw (helmet, visor, safety gloves, chaps) ... but didn't have steel-toed boots.  I was basically wearing sneakers when a heavy log fell on my foot.  Anyway, I purchased these CAT boots based on the reviews, description, and Caterpillar's reputation.  At first I thought they would be too large (I wear a 9 wide), but after putting on heavy socks and tightening the laces over the arch (first 3 or four loop-holes), the fit vastly improved.  My toes have alot of space, and there's absolutely no rubbing, and after wearing them ALL day, they felt fantastic.  No breaking-in needed (in my case).  I don't know much about safety boots, but these have a loophole (fifth from bottom), that seems to allow you to snug-tighten the laces without hurting your feet, and allows flexibility around the ankle.  The sole has a very solid and secure feel--no slipping at all.  I was stepping on sharp rocks and felt absolutely nothing on the soles of my feet.  I should have purchased these years ago.  The only negative (and this is not really a criticism of the boots) is that the sole treads are deep and capture dirt and mud.  You can't walk in your home with these even if you wipe your boots on a brush/scraper.  Again, this is NOT a criticism, but expect that they will catch dirt.","Reviewed in the United States on 18 November 2012","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They're comfortable as hell (although they squeeze my toes together a little, I've gotten used to it though), and they seem pretty durable. I've had them for 8 months and there are no real damages to the boots itself, laces haven't fallen off and the sole is still attached. They're a pain to clean but man are they handsome when they are, unless you don't like markings which there are quite a few of on them. I wear them casually and I get compliments all the time. Favorite thing about them is the rubber over the steel toe. It prevents a lot of scuffing to the leather which is left exposed on many other boots. I'd recommend them any day, although I can't speak for their performance ""on the job"" they do meet the safety standards. If you're wearing them casually you'll definitely wear them past their price tag.P.S. Screw Timbs","Reviewed in the United States on 2 August 2017","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2024","uni Kuru Toga Roulette Model Auto Lead Rotation 0.5mm Mechanical Pencil, Silver Body",NA,"Crampo3105","Classy pencil, one of the nicest in the Kuru Toga line, along with it's brother the High Grade and the Advance Upgrade. It feels so comfortable in the hand. My only wish is that it comes in 0.3mm, my preferred lead size. The grip is fantastic although it could be a tad longer, just the right amount of roughness to grip without going overboard. One of the beat balanced pencils, particularly in this medium price range, along with the higher priced, flawed Pentel Orenz Nero and the iconic Rotring 600. Not rock solid at the tip because of the Kuru Toga engine turning the lead (this applies to all Kuru Togas) but I am getting used to it. The gun metal colour is stunning. The lead feed has a nice positive click. Lacks a lead grade indicator and the lead sleeve is too short for drafting <3mm, so not a true drafting pencil...just have to put your own sticky labels on the pencil if you use different lead grades in your pencils. The inbuilt eraser is tiny but excellent quality for erasing individual  letters or words  and small areas in sketches.

It is the best mechanical pencil I ever owned.It feels great in the hand, is well balanced and it looks good.It has a built in eraser and you can get refills.  You can extend the life of the eraser by loosening the metal grip that holds it and pulling more eraser out.The rotating mechanism is brilliant and works perfectly maintaining the sharpness of your line.  Anyone who knows about mechanical pencils will have spent years rotating the pen in your hand every few words or lines to maintain the sharpness of your line.  This makes using a mechanical pencil a breeze.I can’t imagine I will ever go back to a non rotating version l.  The rotation works by making use of the slight pressure you apply on the tip when you touch the paper. Small gears within are activated, when you press and release, which rotate the lead.  There is a little round window so you can see the rotation occurring.It’s comfortable, sturdy and fun.","Reviewed in Australia on 16 January 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2044","uni Kuru Toga Roulette Model Auto Lead Rotation 0.5mm Mechanical Pencil, Silver Body","Yes, it is as good as it looks!","Sachin","Ok, normally I have to write extended reviews to not only give praise to its features and accomplishments, but also to give a run down on all of their issues and sub par materials.  This Mech, I have to say, is one fine pencil. It isn’t just a great design, it is also technically very sound and I found no bad issues whatsoever. The materials used in the build are all high end. The fittings are masterly snug. And even pulling a line with this pencil feels amazing. Holding this mech in your hand, you can feel the significant difference from how most other pencils feel. This Pencil feel high end. The grip is a hybrid of knurling and grooves. The tip is a little on the large size, but the tubular steps are brilliantly sized with the first step down being sized perfectly for those of us who tend to choke up on pencils when going in for the fine detail. The needle tip holds the lead very firm and stable. There is no excessive play in the needle that would cause flex/bowing or lead chattering. For those of you wondering what that means. When a needle has a little too much excessive play inside, the lead can slightly bounce causing a micro chattering effect you can feel. When the needle has way too much excessive play, it causes the lead to flex and bow easily breaking leads often, also causing precision issues when the lead jumps around in the needle during lay down and lift off of paper.  This “UNI” mech has none of those issues. The lead spiraling function they added to always help keep the lead stay sharp by spinning, works great. And it has a small window on the grip to show that the function is working inside. The lead advancement is about 0.3 to 0.4mm per click. Making it easier to fine tune the perfect length for individuals. Now this Mech isn’t balanced, but Mechs don’t need to be balanced. Not sure why some people get caught up in feeling they need it to be. So I just go Ahead and add that on my list of check points for others. Although, it never holds weight in my reviews and should never be a deciding factor for any user, just as the erasers on Mechs should never be taken into account. I do reviews for real people, Not little children that gets upset cause they have trouble with, or replacing the erasers that they really don’t need to be using in the first place. Personally speaking, if I was to ever design my own Mechanical Pencil, it wouldn’t even have an eraser. Grow up and buy a separate eraser.  Now, let’s get back to the review. This is where I normally have to leave a real complaint about how a clicker head is loose and feels like it moves around to much. But, this clicker head feels ok. Sure it has a small amount of lateral play, but far from being bad. Plus the push clutch feels nice and firm when pushing it in.  And I guess I should add that it has a nice strong feeling clip on this mech, though, I will also add that a clip on a mech is another overrated addition people feel the need to care about. I have never found a time that I was glad that my mech had a nice clip. Haha. Your mech should never be slid into your pocket where it would need that clip. This is not a pen. You shouldn’t be just carrying it around like you will need to be signing your signatures with.  If it needs to go with you some place, then put it in a closing pencil pouch, pencil roll, case, or something that protects it. Not just shoved in a pocket like a cheap Bic pen. All this aside...  let’s finish up this review by letting me tell you that I would highly suggest buying this Mech. I seriously couldn’t really find anything wrong with it. It is easily capable of being on a list of some of the best Mechs on the market. On top of the fact that it isn’t expensive. So you have a great pencil at a great price. This is definitely one to put in your collection.  It’s a 5 star Mech.","Reviewed in India on 21 June 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

La parte che s'impugna è tutta in metallo e garantisce solidità oltre ad una buona fattura.L'unico difetto, anche se non sarebbe da considerarsi tale, è l'estremità della matita fatta in plastica.

"2048","uni Kuru Toga Roulette Model Auto Lead Rotation 0.5mm Mechanical Pencil, Silver Body","Great Everyday Pencil","Riccardo","A quality pencil that writes extremely well. The rotating barrel keeps the lead nice and symmetrical so stays consistent as you write. This also makes it easy to write very small, consistent text. The grip is a textured metal, no soft rubber or silicone. But because of the weight distribution and overall feel, it is still comfortable to hold. The only disadvantage of this pencil would be the eraser. While it erases well and leaves minimal smudges, it is very small. If you want to erase a large area, you better have a larger eraser near by. The plus is the eraser cap is nice and snug which means it won't fall off on it's own.Overall, a great pencil. While it may be more expensive than the cheap ones you can get anywhere, it is not that expensive and definitely worth the price.

Th draughting pencils have a rotating hardness indicator so you can select which grade is installed.The propelling pencils are all HB hardness but in 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 diameter with 24 spare leads per diameter.

Just a warning, when you click down on the thicker leaded pencil, the lead shoots out if you don't have something to stop it. I like it that way, but most people don't know this before they buy it.

Cada vez que voy a la librería a comprar un lápiz suelto de Faber Castell tienen un coste de 1€ o 1€ y poco, hice cuentas y comprando este estuche metálico me salía casi al mismo precio que si los compraba sueltos, la cajita apenas lleva coste adicional así que lo vi una buena opción para ampliar la gama.Lo mejor de estos lápices:-Si tenemos una distinta tonalidad dependiendo de su dureza, cosa que se supone que nos tienen que ofrecer todos los lápices pero os puedo asegurar que no es así.-Esta gama de lápices están muy bien elegidos para crear imágenes o ilustraciones realistas.-Ni parte la punta aún pintemos con ellos recién afilados.-Dan buenos resultados independientemente de utilicemos la técnica de ""sobado"" o ""claro oscuro"".-El estuche metálico en el que vienen nos da un extra a la hora de transportarlos y cerciorarnos de que no hemos perdido ninguno a la hora de guardarlos pues su evidente hueco nos recalca la falta de uno.-Si no son para ti, es un buen regalo para los amantes del dibujo.Son mis habituales, no les he visto lado negativo; bajo mi criterio basándome en mi propia experiencia...

Best pencils for smooth realistic blending. 8B is the highest and it's not as dark as brands like cretacolor, but the precision & quality of material is good. Lead is of fine quality. And 2H, H and F are good in its outline phase.It's not a good choice for rough realism, where you get into deeper combination of highlights and shadows, but it's quite good for smooth realism and neat portrait drawings.Works really well with Hot pressed drawing paper of 200+ GSM and also the 130+ GSM drawing book sheets.Hexagonal shape is of fine grip and good for holding. And it's better to buy a pencil extender along with it. (The one shown in first picture).The packaging was good for the one I received (I've bought it twice), but the product is useless if someone drop it. So make sure the package you receive have enough bubble wrap or other essential packaging means.There are lots of pencil sets in the market, but this one has a good metal box and better quality.Not to be confused with Faber Castell Black matte, that is available at around ₹60 for 6 pencils.And if you want a video review on the product, check out instagram & youtube channel - iAmaljith.","Reviewed in Germany on 22 February 2024","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

In a grand saga of creativity, these pencils are nothing short of legendary!  Whether you're charting a map of unexplored islands or sketching the fearsome sea beasts of the Grand Line, these pencils won't let you down.But wait, there's this other pencil, the Uni Mitsubishi. People say they're the best, like the King of the Pirates of Pencils or something! They've got everything down perfectly, from the grip that feels like a sturdy ship's wheel to the smoothness of drawing a line straight as the horizon.But here's the cool part – these Faber Castell pencils? They're almost just like the Mitsubishi ones. I mean, when I draw with them, I can barely tell the difference. They're like a great crew – reliable and good at what they do.I'm giving these Faber Castell pencils a Ussop-approved 90%! They might not be the Pirate King of pencils, but they're super close.

"2172","Staedtler Noris Colour Coloured Pencils","These pencils are absolutely the best I have tried","CP","I have been testing out different types of mediums for use on Johanna Basfords coloring books as well as well as the Creative Color coloring books.  These pencils are absolutely the best I have tried.  The tips are strong, the color is outstanding on every pencil.  They blend beautifully and I have also used them with Prismacolor blending pencil.  I HIGHLY recommend these pencils if you can find them.  They seem to sell out as soon as they are listed.  Johanna Basford I believe did a special edition box using this pencil set and as far as I have researched the colors are the same.  I feel lucky to have purchased the last 24 pencil box set listed on Amazon a few days ago.  I found that while the Prismacolor pencils were gorgeous and smooth and creamy, the cores kept breaking and the pencils were getting ruined when sharpening - may have been caused by shipping - as the cores were broken.  I am searching for a larger box with more colors of these Stedtler Noris 185 pencils.

"2174","Staedtler Noris Colour Coloured Pencils","Qualità e rispetto per l'ambiente","Rob","Ottima marca per durevolezza delle matite. Se cadono non si rompono le mine, si temperano benissimo e durano molto di più rispetto ad altri colori di altre marche. In più, rispettano l'ambiente ...infatti sono certificati PEFC che indica cheil legno ed i prodotti in legno certificati PEFC provengono da foreste gestite in modo ecologicamente, economicamente e socialmente sostenibile. Sono costruite in WOPEX che è un materiale composto da:Grafite o pigmenti coloranti per la minaWPC (wood-plastic-composite): un materiale innovativo che è composto, in gran parte, da legnoDecorazione nei diversi colori della superficie della matitaTutti i componenti sono trattati sotto forma di granuli in un processo di produzione studiato appositamente. I materiali contenuti nella matita vengono fusi a una temperatura tra 130° C e 180° C, allineati per mezzo di un utensile e modellati a forma di matita per ottenere una barra, inizialmente lunghissima, che viene dapprima raffreddata, poi tagliata alla lunghezza appropriata e infine stampata e appuntitaLa mina omogenea assicura alla matita un'ottima scorrevolezza sulla carta! Le uso anche per i mandala su cartoncino rigido..Grazie alla densità del materiale, la matita ha inoltre un peso maggiore e si tiene comodamente e saldamente in manoLa matita offre un' esperienza di scrittura unica con la sua superficie antiscivolo, morbida e vellutata .La punta della mina è particolarmente resistente alla rottura e, nel caso di una rottura violente, viene evitata la scheggiatura...che altro volete di più?","Reviewed in Italy on 13 April 2019","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Non conoscevo inizialmente questo marchio, però informandomi e provandole personalmente mi sono accorto di quanto siano di qualità. Non solo vengono consigliati a chi studia nelle accademie di belle arti, ma hanno una qualità costruttiva eccezionale. La linea Academy permette di creare sfumature di vario genere, senza rovinare troppo il foglio. Il tratto non è troppo pesante e non necessita di grande pressione per poterci disegnare. La matita in se è di ottima qualità. Non appena riceverete la confezione a casa, vi troverete davanti ad una scatola di metallo molto comoda e resistente, con all'interno un set di colori da 24, ideali per dei disegni con non troppe sfumature. Se volete semplicemente disegnare su carta, vi consiglio di acquistare queste per il prezzo più basso, altrimenti puntate su altre linee sempre della Derwent.","Reviewed in Spain on 6 April 2022","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

They replaced the specific colours I was having issues with and, though not professional quality (obviously), I have a set of consistent pencils that are actually useful and worth the money. Thank you Derwent for the excellent customer service!**Having used and enjoyed Derwent grahite pencils for some time, I had enough confidence in the brand buy this set of coloured pencils. OK, I knew they were the 'academy' ones, and that they wouldn't be as good as the more professional choice.However, the quality of some of the pencils renders the set virtually useless for more than just basic 'colouring in'.Firstly, the colours of some pencils are questionable - the 'deep red' is not significantly different from the 'red', the 'light blue' is a good deal darker than the 'blue' the 'lime green' and 'acid yellow' are pretty similar and the black is nothing more than a dark gray.Secondly is how the pencils lay down pigment. With some of the pencils they hardly lay down any colour at all. with the purple pencil you feel like you're tearing through the paper just to get some colour on the page. same with 'rose'and blue.Finally, they don't blend all that well. Some colours do, but a lot simply do not. Same thing with burnishing.Having used more expensive pencils in the past, I'd recommend that you don't cut corners, and just go straight to professional grade pencils. You'll have a lot more fun, create more vibrant art, and be a whole lot less frustrated in the process.This purchase feels a lot like £15 wasted.","Reviewed in India on 23 October 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

The technical drawing pencils I already had (0.7 and 0.5) felt too fine. The advantage of a clutch pencil is you don’t have to sharpen it, carry a knife or sharpener, or worry about getting your pencil out to draw and finding the lead broken off. This one feels light, balanced, and comfortable to hold. I like the facets where you grip the pencil, I find that more comfortable than a textured grip which some have. The clip is handy and means hopefully I’m less likely to lose it. I got some 2b leads to try besides the HB it came with.

"2278","Faber-Castell TK Mechanical Pencil 2mm","Nicht nur für technische Zeichnung - auch für Kinder gut geeignet","Familie mit Kind und Kegel","Ich habe diesen Stift für meinen Sohn gekauft, weil er ADHS hat und sich dementsprechend sehr leicht ablenken lässt. Die meisten ADHSler haben eine wahnsinnige Sauklaue, um es mal umgangssprachlich auszudrücken. Bei meinem Sohn habe ich recht früh festgestellt, dass er ziemlich gut schreiben kann, wenn sein Bleistift ganz spitz angespitzt ist. Nach seiner eigenen Einschätzung ist es die Ästhetik, die ihm hilft sich Mühe mit dem eigenem Schriftbild zu geben. Leider lenken herkömmliche Holzbleistifte beim Schreiben in vielerlei Hinsicht ab, z.B. weil man sie ständig nachspitzen muss. Und dann kann man sie auch noch von 2 Seiten anspitzen. Mal ganz abgesehen von der Möglichkeit auf ihnen rum zu kauen.Also habe ich meinem Sohn mehrere verschiedene Druckbleistifte gekauft. Das Schriftbild der feinen Linien hat ihn in der 2. Klasse zu einen ziemlichen guten Schreiber gemacht. Er schreibt gerne und ziemlich flüssig. Leider sind diese Stifte aber doch sehr anfällig für den hohen Druck, den er manchmal beim Schreiben auf das Gerät ausübt, wenn er versucht sich verkrampft auf seine Arbeit zu konzentrieren. Ich habe 6 verschiedene Stifte ausprobiert. Bei allen entstand das gleiche Problem, die Mine rutschte schon nach kurzer Zeit einfach vorne raus.Letztlich habe ich mich vor 2 Wochen für diesen Fallminenbleistift entschieden. Mein Sohn ist hellauf begeistert. Das Schriftbild ist 90% der Zeit sehr fein. Mit dem Anspitzer kommt er gut zu Recht. Es kommt hin und wieder mal vor, dass die Lehrerin ihn nicht aufstehen lässt um seinen Bleistift am Mülleimer anzuspitzen. Dies ist bei diesem Stift kein Problem. Kappe abziehen, anspitzen, fertig. Es entsteht nur minimal Abfall, nicht wie bei Holzstiften. Dort kann man zwar auch Anspitzer mit Aufbewahrungsmöglichkeiten kaufen, die Lenken aber wieder zu sehr ab, da sie oft groß und/oder durchsichtig sind. (Was er mit dem bisschen Abfall macht entzieht sich meiner Kenntnis. Ich kann nur sagen, dass er nicht negativ damit auffällt und weder in den Schulunterlagen, noch in der Federtasche Staub zu finden ist. Vielleicht muss er ihn auch gar nicht so oft anspitzen?)Alle Menschen mit ADHS wissen, wie schwer es ist umständliche und vor allem ablenkende Faktoren in der Umgebung zu minimieren. Gerade bei den ganz alltäglichen Dingen. Ich bin dankbar, dass ich diesen Stift gefunden habe und werde ihn weiterempfehlen.Vielleicht hilft er auch bei anderen Defiziten. Ich muss erwähnen, dass er recht dünn ist (wie bei einfachen Bleistiften auch), was bei grobmotorischen Kindern vielleicht zu Schwierigkeiten in der Handhabung führen könnte. Aber das muss jeder selbst aus seinen Beobachtungen entscheiden. Mein Sohn schrieb schon immer mit dünnen Stiften und hatte keine Probleme mit dem Design dieses Stiftes umzugehen.Den Clip haben wir im übrigen sofort entfernt.","Reviewed in Germany on 3 February 2017","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

These marvels of simple engineering do away with all that business of messy wood shavings and an ever-shortening pencil. In my experience the leads for a clutch pencil last much longer than a conventional pencil of equal length. There is an easy-to-use sharpener in the top of the pencil and a neat place to store it.The Faber pencil has an efficient finger grip on the outside and the mechanism works perfectly, holding the lead tightly without slipping. If you use a pencil a lot and you are fed up with the 'itty-bitty' little leads in propelling pencils (where the leads have the annoying habit of sliding back inside the housing and snapping off in use) then this is the pencil for you.There are many clutch pencils on the market but this is a fine example at a reasonable price - irresistible.","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 December 2013","4.7 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

"2361","STAEDTLER 780 C BKP6 Mars Technico Mechanical Pencil with HB Lead and Eraser,Black","Black Beauty","Guest","Want to read a really boring story? Okay I’m warning you this is lame- like Uber lame. (That’s Uber in terms of super, not the taxi service)The year was unknown but it was 10 years back or so when I was a broke lad, bumming it in college, wallowing in my poor-ness.I worked three jobs and scraped the edges of my piggy bank jar and finally had enough coins and monies collected to walk down to my local art store and I bought a lead holder I obsessed about having. A genuine made in Germany Staedtler 780. At the time then all they had was a blue version. It, Effen, sucked, outright. Being as it was my first lead holder I really wasn’t impressed you see.Why would anyone use this? “You’re just not used to lead holders, you’ll get used to it.” Voice’s would sound in my mind- “ give it another try, go ahead” Giving it time didn’t help, giving it space didn’t help. I had to use it but hated to. The idea of a lead holder made perfect sense, no more short pencils and wasted wood, and maybe there are better brands and models but this one is a good brand! The balance felt like garbage- it felt more weighted towards the tip of the holder, it wasn’t comfortable, it felt like a baby rattle and I didn’t even care for the grip zone, oh and the sharpener was obnoxious...and so I just never used it, and it gained lots of neglect sitting and waiting to be used but I would almost pop an artery every time I used it. It was German made and designed right? How could they make such an unpleasant device meant to be placed in creative hands to warp their ability and frustrate them to the point it needs to be given away to another artist in hopes “it’s not the leadholder, it’s just me”. I thought Germans were known for brilliant and beautifully designed products!I decided that since the 780 was at the time one of the best reviewed lead holders out there and I always loved the Staedtler brand, that it must just be me. Lead holders aren’t for everyone I guessed.Over the years many trees where brutally chopped down and wrapped around graphite sticks to produce wood cased pencils, pencils unfortunately required as sacrifice to satisfy my urge to draw with a pencil more comfortable than that dreaded 780.Over time I decided to give lead holders another shot, but stayed far away from the evil Staedtler 780... I disliked it to say the least and had demented memories and obsessions about it to the point help was required and my doctor called it a rare form of pencil ptsd he had never seen before except on rare occasions of course.After many years of roaming the streets and doing unmentionable things to pay for the pills and thrills and addiction to addiction and anything that could help me forget about that horrible pencil of horrors, I decided to give it another try and picked one up at a local art store and damn! I was impressed! I felt like they’ve improved this pencil significantly and I really enjoyed the inclusion of a handy lead grade indicator incorporated into the clip!Short story is I was swayed in a big way and decided to hunt down the black version which I had to have as well. Both kick ass.Blue version includes eraser 2H lead and two extra 2H leads. The black model includes a beautiful black Staedtler German made rasoplast eraser and yeah it’s black.So buy this or don’t.You won’t regret it as much as you’ve regretted reading this, and time=money so spend it wisely","Reviewed in the United States on 23 February 2021","4.7 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I read good things about these but someone said it flexed when drawing, well what utter nonsense. Sure you might not want to drive over it with a forklift but in normal use this is the perfect pencil for artists or anyone needing a pencil.I like the built in sharpener and being a clutch pencil means it easy to have a longer lead for freer sketching. The free rubber is also good.It's just a shame they don't make them in a range of colours so you could see at a glance between lead softness without having to look at the indicator...","Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 April 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

It's nice to hold with a good weight, the clutch mechanism works well, and there's a metal band at the top that you can twist to mark the type of lead in use (red, 4H, 2H, 4B, 2B, B, HB, blue). Comfort-wise the textured metal that's against your finger if you hold your pencil toward the tip is rough, but I've adjusted by holding it further back and use it for gestural work rather than finer details.

When I am using the metallic Roulette model, the rotating speed, which I hope can be faster, is the part I can complain about. Now the W speed engine in Advance has resolved this issue. I also own Advance Upgrade but its diameter is slightly too large for me and thus Advance is my favorite. This model is now impeccable to me.One thing I'd like to mention is that Uni should put more emphasis on how to correctly use this model.In the traditional models without slide pipe, people tend to have the lead outside the front end approximately 1~2mm. However, this Advance model's slide pipe works in a totally different way. If people keep the old habit on this model, they'll find the lead easily broken since they actually pull the lead too long.","Reviewed in the United States on 25 January 2023","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I pretty frequently noticed that I wasn't actually spinning it while writing and had to change how I wrote to actually get the desired effect. That alone is more personal than actual complaints, but the writing itself just feels wrong. The sleeve is loose and the spongey feeling of when you press down is much more noticable than I anticipated. Still very neat and I love the innovation, but with how prominently featured it is in stationary communities I couldn't help but be a little disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States on 10 May 2022","5.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"
"2428","uni Kuru Toga Advance - Auto Lead Rotating Mechanical Pencil, 0.5mm (Black)","Cool tech, Bad design","Lukas","I purchased the Uni Kuru Toga Advance only because I saw the rotating mechanism. And for the most part, it works flawlessly. However, if you write in cursive or have or have to fill in bubble sheets for a test, this pencil is like any other pencil. This is because it only rotates when you lift the pencil, no while you write. I don't write in cursive, and I prefer a duller tip when coloring in circles. When I write, I don't notice the rotation in the led at all. At the end of a paragraph, I compared the size of the mark left by the led at the top and the bottom, with no discernible difference. I must warn that this rotation mechanism does not keep the led sharp, but it does not keep the led dull either. It stays within a happy medium, and I enjoy it. But now let's talk about the grip and the eraser. Since it is made out of plastic, my fingers are always slipping when I write, but it usually doesn't bother me enough to stop me from using it. The eraser on the smaller side. I find myself needing to replace it every week or two. If you plan on using these pencils a lot, definitely invest in many eraser refills for it. You will also need something along the lines of a needle or the end of a paper clip to dig out the eraser after it gets too small. The pencil has also jammed a lot more than any other pencil. The led has gotten stuck in the part that grips the led, but that was easy to fix. The led has also broken up inside the pencil, preventing other sticks of led from coming out. Overall, if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and a bigger eraser for a rotating mechanism, and don't write in cursive or plan on coloring with it, then it is a good buy. Otherwise, you should look elsewhere.","Reviewed in the United States on 3 November 2019","4.0 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

I had wanted one for a while now, since I had thought it would work well for drawing, but you'd be just as well off, if not better off, just purchasing a pack of regular mechanical pencils.The whole gimmick of this pencil didn't even work. If you just apply pressure to the end without writing, you can see the lead spin, so it had seemed promising. However, once i put pencil to paper, the lead would not spin at all and I might as well have been using a normal mechanical pencil. In fact, it felt far more flimsy than other mechanical pencils I've used that were a fraction of the price.For the price tag, you should expect something that at least feels sturdy, but it was so light weight and felt like cheap plastic. I only just got this today, so I can't tell you how it holds up in the long run, but so far it is an absolute disappointment.Don't waste your money on this broken gimmick. If i had to choose between this and a generic bic mechanical pencil, I'd choose the bic every time. At least you know what to expect from those, and they don't promise you something for an absurd price and fail to deliver. The only reason I would use this pencil is because I feel I have to for the amount of money I spent on this piece of plastic.","Reviewed in Canada on 30 July 2023","4.5 out of 5 stars","Verified Purchase"

Lost it again and my girlfriend ordered 2 more for me!Only problem I have is after long hours of writing, the grip near the base of the pencil gets slippery from my hand sweat. To overcome this I've added some left over sports grip tape and voila! Because the lead stays sharp however, you need to write lightly as to not imprint too heavily on the papers behind the one you're writing on in a notebook. Personally I write with a clipboard behind the paper to make the writing feel extra smooth.The perfect pencil for me to use daily. The lead spins as you lift your pencil and put it down keeping the tip sharp. It's hard to see/find but to refill the lead you just take off the eraser cap and eraser, and there is a smaller than average hole to put lead in. 10/10 product.

The barrel is scuffed and the pencil had no lead inside of it (thankfully I ordered some lead refills, too). The label on the bag says new. The scuffed barrel and clip say otherwise.Curiously, there was a sticker included. I do love stickers, but not enough to overlook being lied to by a seller.I've left the product three stars because it works as advertised, which is nice. I really like the rotating mechanism and I'm very much looking forward to no more pencil sharpening. As some have already pointed out, if you write in cursive, the rotating mechanism won't help you much so I'd recommend looking elsewhere.Finally, the lead guard does have a little give and, after a bit of research, I discovered that this is intentional, too. It's to protect from breakage due to heavy-handed writers.All in all, the product works well and I'm happy with is on that basis.But I hate being lied to. This seller is a liar, so I would recommend buying yours from a reputable retailer like JetPens.com. They've always treated me well and I regret not purchasing this from them.

It presented engineers from two competing pencil manufacturers conceding that this was the most perfect mechanical pencil ever made. So I had to buy one. And truthfully, it is just that. The pencil is much better than any other. It draws a perfect thin, light line; and yet the lead is difficult to break.

Bien por vaguería o porque soy demasiado principiante para darme cuenta, voy buscando un tipo de lápiz que me permita negros intensos, pero que luego no tenga que andar con fijadores para que no se me vaya o se traspase a la hoja de al lado. Los Conté igual se acercaban un poco pero siguen manchando allá por donde pasan.Estos cayeron en mis manos después de ver varios análisis. Al principio me resultaba algo extraña la sensación, ya que no son suaves como un grafito, son como una cera dura, pero los resultados me gustaron mucho. Alcanzan negros mucho más intensos que un grafito (aunque el Steadtler normal 8B no está nada mal) y no tienes ese brillo del grafito que puede ser molesto. A medida que los usas y te acostumbras vas obteniendo mejores resultados y te van gustando más. Se quedan bastante bien en el papel, no difuminan mal, no manchan ni necesitan de fijador.

I used to sketch in pencil, but then started sketching in pen for many years. I recently wanted to go back to pencil sketching, but, couldn't decide what pencils to purchase...I definitely made the right choice here. These pencils are perfection. For anyone who has ever used a 'cheap' pencil, you will notice immediately the difference. These pencils are smooth, and they glide onto the paper with such ease, like a knife through butter...wonderful. There are no 'gritty' bits in the lead. The pencils are not round in shape, they are hexaganel, which personally, I find fit easier in the hand, and do not slip from your fingers. They also sharpen without breaking (use a Staedtler sharpener). In this tin set you get 6B 5B 4B 3B 2B B HB F H 2H 3H and 4H, and I found that more than adequate for me, and for most people, that really would be all you need. The pencils sit perfectly inside a plastic compartment (individual slots), inside the tin, and so they do not move around and get damaged. As I have been sketching for many, many, years, I would say that Staedtler and Derwent are now my only choice.
